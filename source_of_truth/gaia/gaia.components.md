   - Ensuring that resources are managed in a way that preserves them for future generations.

### 3. **Ecological Monitoring**
   - Monitoring the environmental impact of Olympus-616 and providing data-driven insights for improvement.
   - Implementing strategies to reduce the system’s ecological footprint and enhance its sustainability efforts.

### 4. **Earth Integration**
   - Facilitating the integration of Earth-centric principles into the system’s operations and development.
   - Ensuring that Olympus-616 operates in harmony with the natural world, supporting ecological balance and resilience.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Gaia no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Gaia module.
- Ensure alignment between the Gaia module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
