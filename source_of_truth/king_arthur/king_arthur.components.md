This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the King Arthur module.
- Ensure alignment between the King Arthur module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
