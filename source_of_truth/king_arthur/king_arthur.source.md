## Purpose

The *King Arthur* component serves as the module responsible for envisioning a better future out of a dark time within Olympus-616. King Arthur is the anointed carrier of Excalibur, representing truth, righteousness, and light, and his role is to bring this vision into reality.

## Source Material

The legend of King Arthur, particularly the stories surrounding the Sword in the Stone, Excalibur, and the quest for the Holy Grail, serve as the foundational source material for this component. Themes of chivalry, justice, and the pursuit of a higher ideal are integrated into this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *King Arthur* component is essential for guiding the system and its users toward a vision of a better tomorrow. By upholding the ideals of truth, righteousness, and light, King Arthur ensures that Olympus-616 operates in alignment with its highest principles.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As part of the Zeus module, *King Arthur* ensures that the vision of a better future is integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to promote the ideals of justice, truth, and righteousness within Olympus-616.

For further details on how the *King Arthur* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
