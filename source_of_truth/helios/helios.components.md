## Overview

The Helios module serves as the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) module within Olympus-616. Named after the personification of the Sun, Helios symbolizes consistency, reliability, and the perpetual renewal of the system. This module is responsible for automating the integration and deployment of system components, ensuring that the system continuously evolves from the first commit until perpetuity.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Helios module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automating the integration of code changes into the system to ensure seamless and error-free development.
   - Running automated tests to catch issues early in the development process.

### 2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Automating the deployment of system components, ensuring that updates and changes are delivered quickly and reliably.
   - Managing deployment pipelines to ensure smooth rollouts with minimal disruption to the system.

### 3. **System Consistency**
   - Ensuring that all deployments are consistent and reliable, maintaining the integrity of the system.
   - Monitoring and maintaining the deployment process to prevent and resolve any issues.

### 4. **Scalability and Performance**
   - Optimizing the CI/CD processes to handle large-scale deployments and high-performance requirements.
   - Continuously refining deployment strategies to improve system scalability and performance.

## Components Overview

The Helios module oversees several components that facilitate its responsibilities within Olympus-616. Each component is designed to ensure the module's responsibilities are met without compromising the system's integrity.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Helios no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Helios module.
- Ensure alignment between the Helios module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
