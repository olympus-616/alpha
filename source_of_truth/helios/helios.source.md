## Purpose

The *Helios* component serves as the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) module within Olympus-616. Named after the personification of the Sun, Helios symbolizes consistency, reliability, and the perpetual renewal of the system. This module is responsible for automating the integration and deployment of system components, ensuring that the system continuously evolves from the first commit until perpetuity.

## Source Material

The Greek mythological figure Helios, who drives the chariot of the Sun across the sky each day, serves as the foundational source material for this component. Modern CI/CD principles and practices are also integrated to ensure the module's efficiency and reliability.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Helios* component is essential for the continuous evolution of Olympus-616. By automating integration and deployment processes, Helios ensures that the system remains up-to-date, resilient, and able to adapt to changing conditions.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As a critical subcomponent of the Zeus module, *Helios* ensures that CI/CD practices are seamlessly integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to ensure that the system's evolution is continuous and reliable.

For further details on how the *Helios* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
