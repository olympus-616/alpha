### 4. **Integration with Metatron**

   - Providing a secure and reliable foundation for the user’s personal history within Olympus-616.

This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Ensure alignment between the Enoch module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
