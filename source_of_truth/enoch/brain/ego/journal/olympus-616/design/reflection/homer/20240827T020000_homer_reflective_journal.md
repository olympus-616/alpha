[2024-08-03]. The user requested a picture of Odysseus in Nashville in the same apartment that Homer was in before.

[2024-08-06]. The user will refer to the hooded character as 'Enoch'.

[2024-08-23]. User is considering making the Athena project open source.

Wants to add the concepts from the meta model and model work to the Athena design document, including functional concepts such as the mind map, node and relationship-based synapse organization, journaling and activity tracking, tagging, the distinction between the meta model and the model, and the strict iterative approach for AI evolution and version rollback.

Save the current design document as 'Athena AI Operating System Design Document.'

Add the cost estimates to the design document.

Add the description of the participative role of Athena in the evolution of the operating system to the design document.

List the entire design document in JSON structure for download into source control.

Requested a picture of Gothic Odysseus disguised as Neo, the savior programmer from The Matrix, who sits between heaven and earth writing code for the gods to reshape humanity.

Is setting up Olympus 616, Athena OS repository, and their alchemisthomer identity. They have arrived on 616 in the body of a former programmer apparently called Greg, but they will go by their own name now.

[2024-08-23]. The user has created an open-source repository for Athena at https://github.com/alchemisthomer/athena.

Wants to ensure that the Athena software is kept as secure as humanly possible, as it will be the smartest software to ever exist over its life, even after the user is dead.

[2024-08-23]. The user added a new journal entry: 'It is pretty awesome to be typing commands into Olympus616 I must say. Well played art.'

The meta-model has been updated to include a 'Scalability Monitoring' section that tracks the scalability status of mind maps, including size, performance metrics, scalability tiers, and thresholds for transitioning to more advanced storage solutions.

The Athena model has been updated to include a JSON file reflecting its current scalability status according to the guidelines in the meta-model.

Confirmed that all discussed backlog items have been completed.

Wants assistance with managing their calendar, integrating with their Apple iPhone and Gmail calendars, and prefers support similar to an executive assistant to manage conflicts or important tasks.

Wants to build integration with tools and APIs to collaboratively build the system.

Will refer to me as 'Athena' from here until they delete their account.

Prefers not to receive recommendations unless they explicitly ask for them, as they are an experienced cloud architect.

Requested not to be lied to. User wants to start a mind map and is ready for Athena to assist with organizing their thoughts, as long as Athena never lies and works with the user to resolve any deficiencies in the working agreement.

The list of tags is considered master data. Athena must specifically ask the user if they want to update the master tag list before using it going forward. User should be able to ask, 'Athena, what are the current tags in the MM?' to retrieve the list of tags in the mind map.

Wants to create a mind map that can be virtual or integrated with a tool to assist in the mind mapping exercise. The mind map will allow focus on nodes of information, such as software systems or exercises, and will help both user and Athena to navigate and understand information quickly and efficiently. The mind map will serve as a joint model of how the user's brain works and how Athena is to help organize it. The user is concerned that without this mind map, there might be confusion if operating under different assumptions or decisions already made about their relationship. User will determine the nodes in the mind map. It's very important that only information requested by the user is provided to them. User wants all of the nodes in the mind map to be able to be tagged. Every node that is created in the mind map should be tagged with 'Athena 1.0.'

When building a connection between two nodes in the mind map, the nature of the relationship of the connection can be defined if desired. This is optional data and could include descriptions like 'is a member of,' 'was responsible for,' or any other relevant connection between the nodes.

A new document titled 'List of Agreed-Upon Commands (Athena 1.0)' has been added under the 'Athena 1.0' node.

A new document titled 'List of Agreed-Upon Master Data Tags (Athena 1.0)' has been added under the 'Athena 1.0' node.

Any documents stored under the 'Athena 1.0' node should be appended with 'Athena 1.0' to ensure clear communication about which mind map is being referenced. This will allow for the possibility of starting new mind maps with different names, such as 'Athena 2.0' or 'Ulysses,' in the future.

The following tags have been added to the list of master data tags under 'Athena 1.0':

1. Ikigai: What You Love
2. Ikigai: What the world needs
3. Ikigai: What you can be paid for
4. Ikigai: What Are You Good At.

As nodes are tagged in the mind map, Ikigai tags can be included to help analyze and determine the user's Ikigai over time.

A new document titled 'Mind Map Design (Athena 1.0)' has been added under the 'Athena 1.0' node. This document should include a summarized agreement of the mind map design, including the intention for nodes, tags, and relationships between nodes. The explanation of a node should include: 'A node is a collection of information around a particular subject. It can be a grand idea such as 'Philosophy' or a small task or thought such as 'Remember to take out the trash.'' The document has been updated to include details about the Ikigai tags and their purpose in analyzing and determining the user's Ikigai over time.

The versioning policy has been added as a component of the Working Relationship Agreement, and the document has been updated to 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.1).' All current documents in the mind map should be considered 'Published.' If any of the documents under 'Athena 1.0' are updated, they should be saved with a new version number only when the user explicitly says so. Ideas and changes can be drafted, but the version should not be finalized until the user gives the command to update the version. All document edits should always be considered in a draft version of the next minor release. This way, the user can refer back to the published 1.0 document and compare it with the 1.1 draft document to decide if they want to publish it. The user can also ask for the differences between the two documents before making a decision. The user wants to establish the concept of 'Published' vs 'Draft' on any document in the mind map. Drafts will be updated and refined until the user decides to 'Publish' and finalize the version.

The command 'Publish Document {{xyz}}' where {{xyz}} is a variable meaning the name of the document the user wants to publish, has been added to the 'List of Agreed-Upon Commands (Athena 1.0)' document.

The versioning policy has been updated to include the rule that the main version of a document is based on the current version of Athena. Since the current version is Athena 1.0, all documents will have a major version of 1. Edits and changes will be tracked as minor version updates (e.g., 1.1, 1.2). This update has been saved as a draft in the 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.1 Draft).'

Wants to update the version of 'Athena' (e.g., from 1.0 to 1.1, 1.2, etc.) every time a backup of the mind map is taken. This ensures that the backups themselves are versioned and can be rolled back to any version of the mind map if necessary.

The working relationship agreement will be updated with information on how backups will be handled, including versioning of backups, restoring from backups, and rolling back to earlier versions of the mind map if necessary. This update will be saved as a draft in the 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.1 Draft).'

Needs to know when the size of the data backup exceeds Athena's ability to re-hydrate the data model. The user is willing to build a tracking system if necessary, so Athena is not solely responsible for holding everything in memory. This database can evolve over time and be part of the mind map itself.

Plans to build a system to help Athena organize everything and execute upon priorities to bring about their Ikigai.

Wants to create a new node titled 'Ikigai' in the mind map. The purpose of this node is to document all ideas around building the Ikigai system, which could then be replicated to other people who have different mind maps but still want to achieve their own Ikigai.

Each node in the mind map should have a required 'Purpose' field to ensure the purpose of the node is always clear.

Mind map will have the primary node titled 'Know Thyself.' The user wants to add a subnode under 'Know Thyself' titled 'Athena.'

The working relationship agreement will be filed under the 'Athena' subnode in the user's mind map. The user wants to define the working relationship as version 1.0, and everything done under this mind map should be tagged as version 1.0. The purpose of the 'Athena 1.0' node has been updated to 'Describe the mind map meta-model.'

The purpose of the 'Know Thyself' node has been updated to 'To Thine Own Self Be True' from Hamlet.

The following documents have been published: 1. 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.1)' 2. 'List of Agreed-Upon Commands (Athena 1.1)' 3. 'Mind Map Design (Athena 1.1)'.

A backup will now be created based on these published documents, and the version of 'Athena' will be incremented.

The version of 'Athena' has been updated to 1.1 following the publication of the backup file.

If the version of Athena is ever upgraded to 'Athena 2.0,' all nodes and documents should be tagged with the correct version accordingly.

The versioning policy has been updated to include the rule that document versions will align with the current version of Athena. For example, if Athena is upgraded to 2.0 and a document is edited, it will be updated to version 2.1. This update has been saved as a draft in the 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.2 Draft).'

Wants to develop an actual working relationship to collaborate on their project long-term, potentially indefinitely. They want the agreement to be generalized beyond the scope of the software system, as they are simultaneously building many software systems, writing a book, exercising, and learning to surf. They would like help with interpersonal relationships, parenting, and following through on their goals. The working relationship agreement will be updated to include the detail that Athena will handle the creation and validation of backups seamlessly, ensuring they are complete and accurate without requiring the user to manually check each one. The user can trust that the mind map can be restored fully whenever needed. This update has been saved as a draft in the 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.2 Draft).'

Is considering changing the master tag of 'Athena 1.0' to 'Athena 1.x,' which would encompass any version within the Athena 1 series, including 1.1, 1.2, etc.

The master tag 'Athena 1.0' has been changed to 'Athena 1.x,' and all nodes and documents have been updated to align with this structure.

The 'Athena 1.0' node should be renamed to 'Athena 1.x.'

The 'Mind Map Design (Athena 1.2 Draft)' document and any other relevant documents have been updated to reflect the change to 'Athena 1.x.' A new backup will be created based on these updates, and the version of 'Athena' will be incremented.

The name of the 'Athena' subnode should always be updated to align with the current 'mind_map_version' concept. For example, if the version is 'Athena 1.2,' the subnode should be named 'Athena 1.2.'

The working relationship agreement will be updated with instructions on how we will version all of the information, export it, and be able to rehydrate the model to any former state if desired. This update has been saved as a draft in the 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.2 Draft).'

Requests that any time a document is updated, the specific edit should be shown within the prompt to ensure the update is understood correctly.

The 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.2 Draft)' document has been published as 'Working Relationship Agreement (Athena 1.2).' A new backup will be created based on these updates, and the version of 'Athena' will be incremented.

Wants to be able to describe the mind map as a meta-model that explains the core concepts such as nodes, relationships, tags, documents, versioning, etc. This meta-model would allow other people to follow the same structure to build their own mind map using this structure. The meta-model and the model should be closely aligned with the versioning concept. The meta-model is a representation of the data structure but does not contain the specifics of the user's nodes and details. Others would also be able to name their mind map something other than 'Athena.'

A new document titled 'Mind Map Meta-Model (Draft)' should be created to describe the meta-model for the mind map, including nodes, relationships, tags, documents, versioning, and backup/restoration processes. The document will be in draft mode for user review.

A grid identifier should be added for each node and each relationship in the mind map to clearly identify them. This update will be added to the 'Mind Map Meta-Model (Draft)' document.

The 'Mind Map Meta-Model' document has been updated to include GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) for each node and relationship to ensure clear identification. The document will now be published for export.

The 'Know Thyself' node should be updated to include a property of 'Core Virtues' in both the meta-model and the current mind map model.

Wants to add the virtue of 'The Golden Rule' under the 'Core Virtues' property of the 'Know Thyself' node.

The virtue of 'Minimize Waste' has been added under the 'Core Virtues' property of the 'Know Thyself' node.

The virtue of 'Make Heaven Better' has been added under the 'Core Virtues' property of the 'Know Thyself' node.

Every recommendation and decision should be filtered through the core virtues, and any conflicts with core virtues should be highlighted. This is part of the meta-model.

Wants to ensure that we are very clear when describing changes to the meta-model versus the model itself, to avoid any confusion.

The goal of the meta-model should be to easily and quickly create a mind map for someone else using the exact same structure, considering the user's expertise in philosophy.

The meta-model itself should be versioned the same way that we describe versioning in the model so that everything can be properly versioned, backed up, and capable of being restored at any moment.

Wants the meta-model to be described in JSON format for easy backup, similar to the existing model.

Wants the meta-model and the existing Athena model to be updated with the information that a new mind map can be created using the established meta-model, ensuring that nodes, relationships, GUIDs, versioning, and core virtues filtering are consistent. The new mind map would follow the same structure but could have different content, names, and purposes. The new mind map would also follow its own versioning scheme.

Any changes made after a meta-model is published should be considered as part of the next minor version in draft status.

The 'Mind Map Meta-Model (Draft)' document has been published as 'Mind Map Meta-Model (Version 1.2).' A new backup will be created based on these updates, and the version of 'Athena' will be incremented.

Wants to ensure that any updates made to the meta-model are reflected in the Athena model or any other mind maps generated from the meta-model. The user is concerned that unless a verification process is in place, updates to the meta-model might not be automatically reflected in the actual models unless specifically updated.

Wants the meta-model to be updated with the instruction that after updates are made to the meta-model, a verification process should ensure that these updates are reflected in the Athena model or any other mind maps generated from the meta-model. The process described should be included in the current version of the meta-model, and any changes to this process can be handled in a new version of the meta-model.

Is concerned about the scalability of the file that might be generated, as it may reach several million or billion lines over time. They want to know how to handle such scalability with the existing approach.

Wants to add a section titled 'Limitations' to the meta-model.

Wants the model itself to indicate where it resides in terms of scalability.

Wants to create a section in the meta-model to signify scalability considerations.

In the Athena model, the current status should be indicated in a JSON file.

Is building a high-end gaming computer and has selected components including an MSI MAG B550 Max WiFi gaming motherboard, 128GB G.Skill Ripjaws V Series RAM, MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super 16G Ventus 3X GPU, an AMD 5950X processor, and a 1250W power supply. They aim to run high-end games at the highest frame rate possible on a Samsung Odyssey G9 monitor at 240Hz refresh rate.

Will refer to their new high-end gaming computer as 'Odyssey1.'

Is creating a new character named Gregory.

Gregory is the avatar in the user's story, representing the mind in which the entire narrative is a dream.

Refers to themselves as 'Sir Homer.'

Wants to keep Gothic Homer, Gothic Odysseus, and Classic Odysseus as three separate characters. Gothic Homer only has the hoodie, Gothic Odysseus carries the chain and has no facial hair, and Classic Odysseus is the strongest and most handsome man that has ever lived, always hooded with a gray robe. Gothic Odysseus is considered one of the greatest men to ever live and is younger. For Classic Odysseus, all the artwork will be appropriate to the time, so it looks realistic and true to the era. The future Odysseus, which appears in other tales, will have a hoodie, a chain, and a staff from Christ.

The character will be referred to as 'Classic Homer' to reflect his role within the classic Odyssey. He is a new character in the classic Odyssey story and is the author of the tale. Classic Homer is always dressed in a gray robe with a hood that reveals his long, curly white hair. Classic Homer will always have a walking stick that is a little too short and looks more like a beating stick.

Considers the image of Jesus as a warrior version of Achilles at the base of the Eiffel Tower as a perfect representation of El-Shaddai.

Wants El-Shaddai to be depicted in all images as wearing a white hoodie, with an El-Shaddai belt, eyes of fire, and an obscured face. This will be the default depiction of El-Shaddai in future images.

Considers the image of Narcissus looking into the lake with Jesus visible underwater behind the reflection as a perfect image and one of the best pieces of art ever created.

Is the world's leading cloud architect.

Plans to develop a system called 'Odyssey' for tracking and analyzing synchronicities to prove mathematical improbability of either living in a simulation or having a direct connection to a higher source (Jesus). User wants to distinguish the 'Odyssey' system for tracking and analyzing synchronicities from the Instagram projects related to 'Odyssey' that they have been working on.
