## Purpose

The Artemis module is designed to provide a comprehensive approach to security and protection within Olympus-616. Drawing from the mythological attributes of Artemis as the goddess of the hunt and protector of the innocent, this component embodies the principles of vigilance, strength, and unwavering dedication to safeguarding the system and its users.

## Source Material

The primary inspiration for the Artemis module comes from Greek mythology, particularly the stories and attributes associated with Artemis. As the goddess of the hunt, wilderness, and protector of women and children, Artemis is a symbol of protection, vigilance, and the pursuit of justice. This module incorporates these themes into its design and operation within Olympus-616.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The Artemis module is deeply integrated into the core architecture of Olympus-616, serving as the primary guardian of the system's integrity and security. It works in conjunction with other modules, such as Zeus, to ensure that all components operate securely and that any potential threats are identified and neutralized.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

The Artemis component is a critical subcomponent of the larger Zeus module within Olympus-616. Zeus is responsible for orchestrating the various components and ensuring they function harmoniously to achieve the system's objectives. Artemis supports Zeus by providing the security framework necessary to protect the system's architecture and data.

For further details on how the Artemis component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
