## Overview

This document serves as a formalized architecture record for the Artemis module within Olympus-616. It lists and describes all components under the jurisdiction of Artemis, the protection and security module. This document will be continuously updated as new components are added or existing components are modified, ensuring a clear and organized structure of the systemâ€™s protection and security architecture.

## Components Overview

Each component in the Artemis module is designed to ensure that Olympus-616 operates securely and that all users and data are protected from threats. Artemis governs the architecture and the connections between these components, orchestrating a secure environment where every interaction is shielded by robust security measures.

## Components

### Shield Wall

- **Component Name:** [shield_wall](../shield_wall/README.md)
- **Source of Truth:** [shield_wall.source.md](../shield_wall/shield_wall.source.md)  
- **Purpose:** The Shield Wall component provides a first line of defense against external threats, ensuring that Olympus-616's perimeter is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

### Watchtower

- **Component Name:** [watchtower](../watchtower/README.md)
- **Source of Truth:** [watchtower.source.md](../watchtower/watchtower.source.md)  
- **Purpose:** The Watchtower component monitors system activity for suspicious behavior, providing real-time alerts and automated responses to potential threats.

### Moonlight

- **Component Name:** [moonlight](../moonlight/README.md)
- **Source of Truth:** [moonlight.source.md](../moonlight/moonlight.source.md)  
- **Purpose:** The Moonlight component focuses on securing the data and privacy of users, ensuring that sensitive information is encrypted and inaccessible to unauthorized entities.

### Vanguard

- **Component Name:** [vanguard](../vanguard/README.md)
- **Source of Truth:** [vanguard.source.md](../vanguard/vanguard.source.md)  
- **Purpose:** The Vanguard component acts as an advanced threat detection and response system, using machine learning algorithms to identify and neutralize sophisticated attacks on Olympus-616.

### Aegis

- **Component Name:** [aegis](../aegis/README.md)
- **Source of Truth:** [aegis.source.md](../aegis/aegis.source.md)  
- **Purpose:** The Aegis component ensures the overall integrity of the system, providing robust mechanisms for data validation, integrity checks, and rollback processes.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Artemis no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Artemis module.
- Ensure alignment between the Artemis module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
