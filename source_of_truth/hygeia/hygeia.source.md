## Purpose

The *Hygeia* component serves as the health and well-being module within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek goddess of health and cleanliness, Hygeia is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the health of both the Olympus-616 system and its users. This module ensures that the system operates at optimal health and that users are supported in their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

## Source Material

The role of Hygeia in Greek mythology, who is associated with health, cleanliness, and sanitation, serves as the foundational source material for this component. Modern principles of healthcare, wellness, and preventive medicine are also integrated to guide this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Hygeia* component is essential for ensuring that both the system and its users maintain optimal health and well-being. By monitoring and supporting health-related functions, Hygeia ensures that Olympus-616 operates smoothly and that users are provided with the resources they need to maintain their well-being.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As a critical subcomponent of the Zeus module, *Hygeia* ensures that health and well-being practices are seamlessly integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to promote the physical, mental, and emotional health of both the system and its users.

For further details on how the *Hygeia* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
