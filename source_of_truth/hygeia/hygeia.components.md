## Overview

The Hygeia module serves as the health and well-being module within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek goddess of health and cleanliness, Hygeia is responsible for monitoring and maintaining the health of both the Olympus-616 system and its users. This module ensures that the system operates at optimal health and that users are supported in their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

## Scope of Responsibility

### 1. **System Health Monitoring**
   - Monitoring the overall health and performance of Olympus-616, ensuring that the system operates efficiently and effectively.
   - Implementing preventive measures to avoid potential system issues and maintaining system integrity.

### 2. **User Well-Being**
   - Providing tools and resources to support users in maintaining their physical, mental, and emotional health.
   - Integrating well-being practices into the user experience, encouraging a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

### 3. **Health Data Management**
   - Managing and analyzing health-related data to provide insights into system and user well-being.
   - Ensuring that health data is handled with the highest standards of privacy and security.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that health and well-being are integrated into the broader system architecture.
   - Harmonizing the principles of health and wellness with the operations and decision-making processes throughout Olympus-616.

This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Hygeia module.
- Ensure alignment between the Hygeia module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
