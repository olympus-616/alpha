## Overview

The Prometheus module serves as the Innovation and Knowledge Sharing module within Olympus-616. Named after the Titan who brought fire (symbolizing knowledge and innovation) to humanity, Prometheus is responsible for fostering creativity, innovation, and the dissemination of knowledge across the system. This module drives the continuous evolution and improvement of Olympus-616 by encouraging the exploration of new ideas and the sharing of wisdom among users and components.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Prometheus module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Innovation**
   - Fostering a culture of creativity and innovation within Olympus-616.
   - Encouraging the exploration of new ideas, technologies, and methodologies to enhance the system's capabilities.

### 2. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Facilitating the sharing of knowledge and wisdom among users and components within Olympus-616.
   - Ensuring that valuable insights and discoveries are accessible to all who interact with the system.

### 3. **Research and Development**
   - Supporting research and development efforts that drive the continuous evolution of Olympus-616.
   - Providing tools and resources for experimentation and the implementation of innovative solutions.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that innovation and knowledge sharing are integrated into the broader system architecture.
   - Harmonizing the principles of creativity and continuous improvement with the operations and decision-making processes throughout Olympus-616.

## Components Overview

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Prometheus no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Prometheus module.
- Ensure alignment between the Prometheus module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
