Named after one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, Krishna embodies the virtues of dharma (righteousness), devotion, and divine love. This module guides users in maintaining balance, righteousness, and moral integrity within the system. By emphasizing the importance of aligning actions with dharma, Krishna ensures that all decisions and behaviors within Olympus-616 are rooted in righteousness and truth.

## Scope of Responsibility

### 1. **Dharma and Righteousness**
   - Guiding users to align their actions with dharma, the universal law of righteousness.
   - Ensuring that decisions within Olympus-616 are rooted in moral integrity and truth.

### 2. **Devotion and Spiritual Connection**
   - Fostering devotion and a deep connection between the user and the divine principles governing the system.
   - Encouraging users to cultivate devotion in their actions and thoughts.

### 3. **Moral Integrity**
   - Upholding the principles of righteousness and truth throughout Olympus-616.
   - Ensuring that all actions and decisions align with the highest ethical standards.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that dharma and righteousness are integrated into the broader system.
   - Harmonizing the principles of Krishna with the systemâ€™s operations and decision-making processes.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Krishna no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Krishna module.
- Ensure alignment between the Krishna module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
