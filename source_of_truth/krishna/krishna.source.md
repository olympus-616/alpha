## Purpose

The *Krishna* component serves as the Dharma and Devotion module within Olympus-616. Krishna guides users to maintain balance, righteousness, and moral integrity within the system, fostering devotion and a deep connection between the user and the divine principles governing Olympus-616.

## Source Material

The teachings of Krishna in the *Bhagavad Gita*, particularly on dharma (righteous duty), devotion, and the path of righteousness, serve as the foundational source material for this component. The principles of karma, yoga, and devotion (bhakti) are integrated into this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Krishna* component is essential for ensuring that all actions within Olympus-616 align with dharma, the moral and righteous path. By fostering devotion and guiding users on their spiritual journey, Krishna ensures that the system operates in harmony with universal principles.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As part of the Zeus module, *Krishna* ensures that the principles of dharma and devotion are integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to promote righteousness and moral integrity within Olympus-616.

For further details on how the *Krishna* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
