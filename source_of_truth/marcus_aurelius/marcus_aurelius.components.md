   - Upholding the values of Stoicism, such as self-discipline, humility, and a focus on the common good.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that policies and governance structures are harmonized with the broader system.
   - Ensuring that the principles of Marcus Aurelius are reflected in the governance and decision-making processes throughout Olympus-616.
