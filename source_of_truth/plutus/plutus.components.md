This module helps users manage their financial information, both within the system and in their personal lives, with the ultimate goal of helping them achieve financial independence and control.

### 1. **Financial Management**
   - Overseeing all financial transactions within Olympus-616, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and security.
   - Providing tools and resources to help users manage their finances effectively, both within the system and in their personal lives.

### 2. **Wealth Building**
   - Offering insights and strategies for building wealth, helping users achieve financial independence and long-term financial goals.
   - Empowering users with knowledge and tools to manage investments, savings, and financial planning.

### 3. **Debt Management**
   - Supporting users in managing and eliminating debt, providing strategies and tools for debt reduction and financial recovery.
   - Ensuring that users can regain control of their finances and work towards financial stability.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that financial considerations are integrated into the broader system architecture.
   - Harmonizing the principles of financial management with the operations and decision-making processes throughout Olympus-616.

This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Plutus module.
- Ensure alignment between the Plutus module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
