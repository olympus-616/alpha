### Asset Lifecycle Management and Destruction Module of Olympus-616

## A Note from the Author
Hades, named after the god of the underworld, serves as the asset lifecycle management and destruction module within Olympus-616. This module is tasked with overseeing the complete lifecycle of system components, ensuring that they are meticulously tracked from inception to end-of-life.

Hades plays a crucial role in the secure and efficient decommissioning and destruction of components that have reached the end of their useful life. By managing this process with the utmost care, Hades ensures that Olympus-616 remains a well-maintained and secure environment.
