## Overview

The Hades module serves as the asset lifecycle management and destruction module within Olympus-616. Named after the god of the underworld, Hades is responsible for overseeing the complete lifecycle of system components, from inception to end-of-life. This module ensures that all components are tracked throughout their lifecycle, and when they reach the end of their useful life, they are securely and efficiently decommissioned and destroyed.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Hades module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Asset Lifecycle Management**
   - Tracking the lifecycle of all system components from creation to end-of-life.
   - Ensuring that all components are maintained and managed according to their lifecycle stage.

### 2. **Decommissioning**
   - Overseeing the secure and efficient decommissioning of components that have reached the end of their useful life.
   - Ensuring that no legacy issues or residual data remain after decommissioning.

### 3. **Destruction and Disposal**
   - Implementing procedures for the secure and complete destruction of obsolete components.
   - Ensuring that all destruction processes comply with system-wide security and environmental standards.

### 4. **Legacy Management**
   - Managing legacy components and ensuring that their decommissioning does not impact the overall systemâ€™s integrity.
   - Providing strategies for the smooth transition from legacy components to new or updated ones.

## Components Overview

The Hades module oversees several components that facilitate its responsibilities within Olympus-616. Each component is designed to ensure the module's responsibilities are met without compromising the system's integrity.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Hades no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Hades module.
- Ensure alignment between the Hades module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
