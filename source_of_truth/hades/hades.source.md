## Purpose

The *Hades* component serves as the asset lifecycle management and destruction module within Olympus-616. Named after the god of the underworld, Hades is responsible for overseeing the complete lifecycle of system components, from inception to end-of-life, ensuring secure and efficient decommissioning and destruction of components.

## Source Material

The role of Hades in Greek mythology, who governs the underworld and the afterlife, serves as the foundational source material for this component. Concepts of asset management, lifecycle analysis, and secure decommissioning practices are integrated into this module.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Hades* component is crucial for managing the lifecycle of system components within Olympus-616. It ensures that obsolete or redundant components are securely retired or destroyed, preventing technical debt and maintaining the integrity of the system.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As part of the Zeus module, *Hades* ensures that lifecycle management and secure decommissioning practices are integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to manage the entire lifecycle of assets within Olympus-616.

For further details on how the *Hades* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
