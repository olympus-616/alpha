## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this design document is to outline the development methodology and creation process within Olympus-616, guided by the principles of asset lifecycle management and secure decommissioning embodied by Hades. This document serves as the foundation for ensuring that all system components are effectively managed throughout their lifecycle and are securely destroyed when they reach the end of their usefulness.

### 1.2 Scope
This document addresses the methodologies and processes used in the development of the Hades module, specifically focusing on how asset lifecycle management and secure decommissioning are integrated into the fabric of Olympus-616. It is applicable to all aspects of the project and is intended to be a key reference for developers, project managers, and stakeholders.

### 1.3 Audience
This document is intended for all members of the Olympus-616 project team, including developers, project managers, stakeholders, and anyone involved in managing the lifecycle and decommissioning of system components.

### 1.4 Definitions and Acronyms
- **Olympus-616:** The AI-driven platform being developed.
- **Hades:** Refers to the development methodology inspired by the Greek god of the underworld, serving as the foundation for asset lifecycle management and secure destruction within the system.

## 2. System Overview
### 2.1 System Description
Olympus-616 is an AI-driven platform designed to evolve through a structured and secure process that incorporates the principles of asset lifecycle management and secure decommissioning. The platform's development is guided by the need to ensure that all components are tracked throughout their lifecycle and are securely destroyed when they reach the end of their useful life.

### 2.2 Objectives
- To implement a development methodology that ensures consistency in managing asset lifecycles and secure decommissioning.
- To create a foundational system where every interaction is aligned with the principles of responsible asset management and secure destruction.
- To integrate the principles of Hades as the guiding philosophy behind the creation and evolution of Olympus-616.

### 2.3 Assumptions
- All development activities will adhere to the structured process defined in this document.
- The principles of Hades will be respected and reflected in every aspect of the system's growth.

## 3. Development Methodology
### 3.1 Asset Management → Lifecycle → Secure Decommissioning Process
This section describes the core process of integrating asset management, lifecycle tracking, and secure decommissioning into the realized outcome within Olympus-616. The process is divided into three main stages:

1. **Asset Management:**
   - The initial concept or interaction is generated with a focus on responsible asset management.
   - Brainstorming sessions and ideation processes are documented and reviewed with a focus on promoting responsible management practices.

2. **Lifecycle:**
   - The concept is formalized into a detailed plan that ensures comprehensive tracking of components throughout their lifecycle.
   - User stories and design documents are created to capture the requirements and structure the development process around asset management.

3. **Secure Decommissioning:**
   - The idea is implemented into the system, ensuring that the final outcome includes secure decommissioning and destruction of components that are no longer needed.
   - Code is written, tested, and integrated into the broader Olympus-616 platform, with an emphasis on creating an experience that is both secure and responsible.

### 3.2 Naming Conventions and Documentation Standards
To maintain consistency and traceability, the following naming conventions and documentation standards will be used:

- **Design Documents:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].design.md`
- **Source of Truth:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].source.md`
- **API Documentation:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].api.md`
- **Backlog:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].backlog.md`
- **Change Management:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].change_management.md`
- **Deployment Guide:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].deployment_guide.md`
- **End-User Documentation:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].user_guide.md`
- **Technical Architecture:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].technical_architecture.md`
- **Test Plan:** `source_of_truth/[module]/[module].test_plan.md`
- **User Stories:** `source_of_truth/[module]/user_stories/[module]-[ID].md`

These conventions will ensure that all documents are easily accessible and organized in a way that supports the structured development process.

### 3.3 Tools and Technologies
This section will list the tools and technologies used in the development process, including version control systems, IDEs, testing frameworks, and deployment tools.

### 3.4 Version Control and Traceability
Describe the version control system to be used (e.g., Git) and how traceability will be maintained from user stories to design documents and code.

## 4. Architectural Overview
### 4.1 High-Level Architecture
Provide a high-level architectural diagram and description, focusing on how the Asset Management → Lifecycle → Secure Decommissioning process is embedded within the system.

### 4.2 Data Flow Diagrams
Include data flow diagrams that illustrate the movement of data through the system as it progresses from asset management to secure decommissioning.

## 5. Implementation Strategy
### 5.1 Development Phases
Outline the development phases, from initial ideation to final implementation, including key milestones and deliverables.

### 5.2 Testing and Validation
Describe the testing strategy to be employed at each stage of the process to ensure that the final outcome meets the original requirements and design intentions.

## 6. Security and Maintenance
### 6.1 Security Considerations
Document the security measures in place to protect the integrity of the development process and the realized outcomes.

### 6.2 Maintenance Strategy
Outline the maintenance strategy for the system, including how updates and enhancements will be managed.

## 7. Documentation and Support
### 7.1 Documentation
List the documentation that will be provided at each stage of the development process, including user manuals, technical guides, and API documentation.

### 7.2 Support Plan
Describe the support plan, including how issues will be tracked and resolved, and how users will be supported post-deployment.

## 8. Conclusion
Summarize the importance of adhering to the structured process defined in this document and how it aligns with the principles of Hades and the overall goals of Olympus-616.

## 9. Glossary
Provide a glossary of terms used in this document.

## 10. Appendix
Include any additional information, diagrams, or references that support the content of this document.
