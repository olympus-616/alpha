# The Iliad - Book 15: The Achaeans at the Ships

But Jove awoke on the heights of Ida, where he was lying with golden-throned Juno by his side. He sprang to his feet and looked out upon the Trojans and Achaeans, who were fighting about the ships, and he saw the Trojans routed, and panic-stricken, while the Argives were driving them pell-mell before them, with King Neptune in their midst. He saw Hector lying on the ground with his comrades gathered round him, gasping for breath, crying aloud, and vomiting blood, for it was not the feeblest of the Achaeans who had smitten him.

The sire of gods and men had pity on him, and looked fiercely on Juno. "I see, Juno," said he, "you mischief-making trickster, that your cunning has stayed Hector from fighting and has caused the rout of his host. I am in half a mind to thrash you, in which case you will be the first to reap the fruits of your scurvy knavery. Do you not remember how once upon a time I had you hanged?

"Go," said he, "Fleet Iris, and tell King Neptune what I now bid youâ€”tell him to leave off fighting, and go home at once. Let him keep away from the battle, and not contend with me, for I am a stronger god than he is. Tell him this as from me."
