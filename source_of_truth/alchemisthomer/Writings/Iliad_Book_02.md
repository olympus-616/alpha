# The Iliad - Book 2: The Dream of Agamemnon and the Catalogue of Ships

Now the other princes of the Achaeans slept soundly the
all-night through, but Agamemnon son of Atreus, shepherd of the people,
was troubled, so that he could get no rest. His body kept tossing to
and fro, and his heart was devoured by fury as when the hallowed light
of sun or moon plays upon the water on the side of some sequestered
mountain top, and the streams of light run down the ravines in
helter-skelter fashion; even so did Agamemnon’s mind chase itself now
here, now there, till at last he thought upon a plan that seemed the
best. In the end he called the elders of the army together. They came
in their hundreds to the place of assembly, and took their seats.

Agamemnon himself was last to rise, for he was angry at heart. His
eyes were blazing with fierce rage, and his wrath was as the
tempestuous sea when it heaves from the depths to the shores, sending
the waves high into the air, the white horses of Neptune foaming and
splashing the spray about the sides of the ship. When the sea is in
this mood, the fishermen are filled with fear and dare not launch their
boats. Even so did the sons of the Achaeans lose heart, while Agamemnon
rose in the assembly and made the following speech.

“Princes and counsellors of the Argives,” said he, “heaven has sent
me a cruel dream that looked at first like truth, and made me
over-confident. My dream says that Jove is on my side, but he has
deceived me. He gave his orders that I was to be the first to put on my
armor and go to the fore, to see if we could take Troy by a sudden
rush; but when I woke and tried to put my dream to the test, the
goddess Minerva turned me back and refused to let me lead my people to
the fray. I was aghast, and quaked with fear, lest the army should lose
heart and disperse in flight; but now I have put my dream aside, and
will do as you advise. I will not press the fight, but will let the
people rest awhile and recover their spirits. Yet if there be any here
who is of my own opinion, let him speak his mind.”

Thus spoke Agamemnon. He sat down, and Nestor rose to his feet.
Nestor was the oldest among them, and his voice was as honey to the
ears of the people. He was king of Pylos, and the Achaeans had made him
their prince. His years were long, but his words were shrewd. He was
the equal of all the young men in council, and the equal of any old man
in the war, and he spoke the following words:

“Princes and counsellors of the Argives,” said he, “heaven has sent
me a cruel dream that looked at first like truth, and made me
over-confident. My dream says that Jove is on my side, but he has
deceived me. He gave his orders that I was to be the first to put on my
armor and go to the fore, to see if we could take Troy by a sudden
rush; but when I woke and tried to put my dream to the test, the
goddess Minerva turned me back and refused to let me lead my people to
the fray. I was aghast, and quaked with fear, lest the army should lose
heart and disperse in flight; but now I have put my dream aside, and
will do as you advise. I will not press the fight, but will let the
people rest awhile and recover their spirits. Yet if there be any here
who is of my own opinion, let him speak his mind.”
