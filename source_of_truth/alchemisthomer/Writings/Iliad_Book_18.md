# The Iliad - Book 18: The Shield of Achilles

Thus then did the Achaeans hold the field like a swarm of bees that
sorely harass the heart of a wayfaring man who happens upon them and
starts to flee with trembling legs, but they attack him as they
sweat him with their stings, while he plunges into a thicket. Even
so did the Achaeans drive the Trojans hither and thither as they
swarmed out over the plain by the ships. And now, among the foremost of
them, Achilles burst into tears, and cried aloud to his mother, "Mother,
thou hast borne me to a bitter fate; would that I had been the son of
one that had grown old among his own people, or had been destined to
live my days out in peace at home, instead of being doomed to a
pitiful end. But as it is, my doom has been fixed by the will of heaven,
and I shall die a grievous death." 

Thus did Achilles speak, weeping bitterly, and his mother heard him
as she sat in the depths of the sea, whereupon she rose as it were a
grey mist over the waves, went up into the air, and took her seat by
the side of her weeping son. Then she laid her hand upon him and said,
"My son, why are you thus weeping? What sorrow has come upon you? Tell
me that I may share your grief with you."

Achilles said, "You know it well enough, my mother, yet will I tell
it you all the same. Patroclus is dead, and the Trojans are fighting
for his body. He has fallen between the ships and the city, and I have
lost him whom I loved so dearly that I could not even save him from
death. He has gone down to the house of Hades, and my heart will never
again know peace. I could not even be with him to save his life, though
I sat here in my tent and wept for him. But now I must go forth, to avenge
the death of my friend, and slay the Trojans, till I have sated the desire
of my heart for revenge." 

Achilles thus spoke, and the goddess Thetis wailed aloud as she
heard him. Then she took her son by the hand, and bade him have
patience. "My son," said she, "be patient, and do not go forth to
fight, till I can get you new armor, which the god Hephaestus will make
for you."
