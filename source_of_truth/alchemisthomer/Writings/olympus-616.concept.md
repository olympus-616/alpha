Dante Alighieri, one of the greatest Italian poets of the Middle Ages, is best known for his epic poem, The Divine Comedy. This monumental work is divided into three parts and is considered one of the most important works of world literature. Here are his key works:

1. The Divine Comedy (La Divina Commedia)
Composed: c. 1308–1320

Summary: The Divine Comedy is an epic poem that describes Dante's journey through the three realms of the dead: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise). The poem is an allegory of the soul's journey towards God, filled with rich symbolism and historical references. The structure is composed of three canticles, each containing 33 cantos, plus one introductory canto, making a total of 100 cantos.

Inferno (Hell): Dante is guided by the Roman poet Virgil through the nine circles of Hell, where he witnesses the punishments of the damned. Each circle represents a different sin, with punishments corresponding to the nature of the sin.

Purgatorio (Purgatory): After Hell, Dante and Virgil ascend the mountain of Purgatory, where souls atone for their sins before they can enter Heaven. The mountain is divided into terraces, each corresponding to one of the seven deadly sins.

Paradiso (Paradise): In the final part, Dante is guided by Beatrice, the woman he loved, through the nine spheres of Heaven, where he meets saints, angels, and the blessed. The poem culminates in a vision of God.

2. La Vita Nuova (The New Life)
Composed: c. 1294
Summary: La Vita Nuova is a prosimetrum (a work combining prose and verse) that chronicles Dante's love for Beatrice Portinari, whom he idealizes as a symbol of divine love.

It is considered an early example of the "dolce stil novo" (sweet new style) of Italian poetry.
3. De Monarchia (On Monarchy)

4. Convivio (The Banquet)
Composed: c. 1304-1307
Summary: Convivio is an unfinished philosophical work that Dante intended to be a comprehensive guide to knowledge and wisdom. It consists of four books, with only the first book fully completed. The work covers a wide range of topics, including ethics, politics, and the nature of human happiness, combining poetry with philosophical discourse.
5. De Vulgari Eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular)
Composed: c. 1303-1305
Summary: De Vulgari Eloquentia is a treatise in Latin that argues for the use of the Italian vernacular in literature, rather than Latin, which was the scholarly language of the time.

6. Epistles (Letters)
Composed: Various dates
Summary: Dante wrote a number of letters to political leaders, patrons, and friends, discussing political events, his own exile, and his views on philosophy and theology. These letters provide valuable insights into Dante's thoughts and the context in which he lived.
7. Eclogues
