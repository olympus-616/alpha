# The Iliad - Book 7: The Duel of Hector and Ajax

With these words Hector passed through the gates, and his brother
Alexander with him, both eager for the fray. As when heaven sends a
breeze to sailors who have long looked for one in vain, and have
laboured at their oars till they are faint with toil, even so
welcome was the sight of these two heroes to the Trojans.

Thereon Alexander killed Menesthius the son of Areithous; he lived
in Arne, and was the son of Areithous the Mace-man, and of Phylomedusa.
Hector threw a spear at Eioneus and struck him dead with a wound in the
neck under the bronze rim of his helmet. Glaucus, son of Hippolochus,
captain of the Lycians, killed Iphinous the son of Dexius, by hurling a
spear at him as he was mounting his chariot, and the bronze point
struck him in the shoulder, so that he fell from his car and his limbs
were loosened.

In like fashion the son of Atreus and the son of Tydeus went about
among the host, cheering them on to fight. The first man of the
Achaeans who was killed by Hector was Teuthras, the son of Orestius, a
great man among the Boeotians, who had brought many ships with him from
Hyle. The second was Orestes, who came from a fruitful countryside
near the River Cephisus. The third was Schedius, son of Iphitus, captain
of the Phocians, and the fourth was Periphas, son of Copreus, who was
one of the Myrmidons. The fifth was Hippothous, and the sixth was
Thales.

Then Pallas Athena came down from heaven and put valor into the
hearts of the Achaeans, that they might hold their own against the
Trojans. Thereon Menelaus of the loud battle-cry exhorted Antilochus and
said, "Antilochus, son of Nestor, you are young and might excel in
any of the affairs of war, if you would only put forth your power. Take
your stand therefore in front of your countrymen and protect them
against this man who is bringing ruin on our host." When Antilochus
heard this he sprang forward and stood in front of his comrades,
checking Hector. Hector struck at him with his spear, but he swerved
and avoided it. Antilochus then threw, and struck the son of
Areithous, Ocyntius, in the breast, and he fell heavily to the ground
with a thud.

Hector was sorely grieved at the fall of his comrade, but he let
him lie where he fell, and went in pursuit of Antilochus, who took
refuge under the shelter of his comrades. When they saw Hector
approaching they threw their spears at him, but he was too quick for
them, and took shelter under his comrades, and so saved his life.

Thereon Hector shouted to the Trojans, "Trojans, Lycians, and
Dardanians, good in close fight, be men, my friends, and fight with
might and main, while I put on the armor of the great Achilles,
which I took when I slew Patroclus."
