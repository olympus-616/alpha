# The Iliad - Book 9: The Embassy to Achilles

Then the Trojans having armed themselves, marched in their companies
with cries and shouts like birds, but the Achaeans went silently,
breathing rage, and determined to stand by one another.

As when the south wind spreads a mist upon the mountain tops, and
shepherds cannot see one another, even so dense was the darkness
that gathered around the foot of the Trojans and Achaeans as they
marched along the plain. But the gleam of their arms, as they came
together, flashed like a flame of fire. And now as they were about to
close, warlike Alexander strode in front, and at once Menelaus saw him.
The heart of the son of Atreus swelled with rage, and he brandished
his spear as a lion when he finds the carcase of some large deer
feeds at his will, though dogs and youths set upon him, even so did
Menelaus exult in the hope of punishing Paris.

But Paris quailed as he saw him coming, and shrank in fear of his
life under cover of his men. As one who comes across a serpent in some
mountain glade starts back in dismay, and his limbs tremble under him,
even so did Paris plunge into the throng and he feared his
adversary. But Hector saw him, and rebuked him with words of scorn.

"Paris," said he, "evil-hearted Paris, fair to see, but woman-mad
and false of tongue, would that you had never been born, or that you had
died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced and looked askance
at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one to
champion us who is fair to see but a coward at heart? Did you not, such
as you are, get your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did
you not, from your far country, carry off a lovely woman wedded among
a people of warriors, to bring sorrow upon your father, your city, and
your whole country, but joy to your enemies, and hangdog shamefacedness
to yourself? And now you dare not stand up to brave Menelaus, and learn
what manner of man it is whose wife you have stolen. Where indeed would
be your lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair
favour, when you were lying in the dust before him? The Trojans are a
weak-kneed people, or ere this you would have had a shirt of stones
for the wrongs you have done them."

And Paris answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just; you are hard as
the axe which a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber
to his liking. As the axe in his hand, so keen is the edge of your
scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that golden Venus has
given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the
gods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the
asking. If you would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans
and Achaeans take their seats, while he and I fight in their midst for
Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be victorious and prove to
be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them
to his home, but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace,
whereby you Trojans shall stay here in Troy, while the Achaeans go home
to Argos and the land of the Achaeans."

When Hector heard this he was glad, and went about among the Trojan
front to hold back the other men, and they all sat down. But the
Achaeans were still aiming at them, and wounding one another, till
Agamemnon shouted, "Hold, Argives, for the command of Hector." Then
Hector placed the two armies in array, and he took two spears, and
marched in their midst with a sword at his side. He went to the
Trojans, and shouted with a great voice: "Hear me, Trojans and
Achaeans, that I may speak even as I am minded. Jove has sent me to
you this day to settle a quarrel between you and the Achaeans. Bid
them lay down their arms, and let us fight man to man. The rest of you
hold back and sit down, while Menelaus and I will fight for Helen and
all her wealth, let him who shall be victorious bear her and her
treasures to his home."
