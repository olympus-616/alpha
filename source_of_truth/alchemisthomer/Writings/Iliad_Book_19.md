# The Iliad - Book 19: The Reconciliation of Achilles and Agamemnon

Now the Achaeans, when they reached their ships and the Hellespont,
dispersed every man to his own ship. But Achilles would not let the
Myrmidons go; he spoke to his brave comrades saying, "Myrmidons, famed
horsemen and my own trusty comrades, let us not yet unyoke our
steeds, but with horse and chariot draw near to the body and mourn
Patroclus, in due honour to the dead. When we have had full comfort
of lamentation we will unyoke our horses and take supper here."

On this they all joined in a cry of wailing, and Achilles led them
in their lament. Thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing
round the body, and Thetis stirred within them a still deeper yearning.
The sands of the seashore and the men's armour were wet with their
weeping, so great a minister of fear was he whom they had lost. Chief
in all their mourning was the son of Peleus: he laid his bloodstained
hands on the breast of his friend. "Fare well," he cried, "Patroclus,
even in the house of Hades. I will now do all that I erewhile
promised you; I will drag Hector hither and let dogs devour him raw;
twelve noble sons of Trojans will I also slay before your pyre to avenge
you." 

As he spoke he treated the body of noble Hector with contumely,
laying it at full length in the dust beside the bier of Patroclus.
The others then put off every man his armour, took the horses from
their chariots, and seated themselves in great multitude by the
ship of the fleet descendant of Aeacus, who thereon feasted them
with an abundant funeral banquet. Many a goodly ox, with many a sheep
and bleating goat did they butcher and dress; many a tusked boar,
moreover, fat and well-fed, did they singe and set to roast in the flames
of Vulcan; and the wind carried the savour thereof far over the
army. 

But the blessed gods looked down with pity from heaven on the son
of Peleus, and urged Mercury slayer of Argus to steal the body of
Hector, and so cheat Achilles of his glory. All were of this mind save
only Juno, Neptune, and Joveâ€™s grey-eyed daughter, who persisted in
the hate which they ever bore towards Ilius with Priam and his
people; for they forgave not the wrong done them by Alexandrus in
despising the goddesses who came to him when he was in his sheepyards,
and preferring her who had offered him a wanton to his ruin.
