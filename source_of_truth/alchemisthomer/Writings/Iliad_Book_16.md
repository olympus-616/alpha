Patroclus reached Achillesâ€™ tent and wept, in grief that the Achaeans should be so hard pressed. "Achilles," said he, "if you are still so inexorable, if your heart will not yet be moved, think at least of those who are now sorely wounded. They are lying in their tents, wounded by the arrows of the Trojans or by the spears of these great warriors, so many of whom we have slain in battle. You were unfeeling, Achilles; let it not be said that your unreasoning anger brought disaster upon the host. You may ...

Achilles, moved by these words, let fall a tear; then he rose to his feet, and clasped his hands before him. "My mother," said he, "I was indeed ill-starred; you bore me into the world with a curse upon my head. I shall not live long, but shall be cut off in the midst of my years. Nevertheless, Patroclus, I can no longer keep you here, for the gods themselves must have a hand in this matter. If you insist, I will let you go, but you must swear to me that you will not go near Hector, nor challenge him ...

The Trojan ranks were broken by the death of Patroclus, and the Trojans fled to the safety of their walls. Achilles wept for the death of his friend, and his cries were heard by his mother, Thetis, who came to him. She comforted him, and promised to procure him new armor, for his old armor had been taken by Hector. The two of them sat down and talked, while the Myrmidons continued to fight the Trojans.
