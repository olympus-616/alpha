# The Iliad - Book 6: Hector and Andromache

The fight between Trojans and Achaeans was now left to rage as it would,
and the tide of war swayed here and there over the plain as they aimed
their bronze-shod spears at one another between the streams of Simois
and Xanthus.

First, Ajax son of Telamon, tower of strength to the Achaeans, broke
a phalanx of the Trojans, and came to the assistance of his comrades by
killing Acamas son of Eussorus, the best man among the Thracians, being
both brave and of great stature. The spear struck the projecting peak
of his helmet: its bronze point then went through his forehead into the
brain, and darkness veiled his eyes.

Then Diomedes killed Axylus son of Teuthranus, a rich man who lived
in the strong city of Arisbe, and was beloved by all men; for he had a
house by the roadside, and entertained every one who passed; howbeit
not one of his guests stood before him to save his life, and Diomedes
killed both him and his squire Calesius, who was then his charioteer—so
the pair passed beneath the earth.

Euryalus killed Dresus and Opheltius, and then went in pursuit of
Aeseptus and Pedasus, whom the naiad nymph Abarbarea had borne to
noble Boucolion. Boucolion was eldest son to Laomedon, but he was a
bastard. While tending his sheep he had converse with the nymph, and she
conceived twin sons; these the son of Mecisteus now slew, and he stripped
the armour from their shoulders. Polypoetes then killed Astyalus, Ulysses
Pidytes of Percote, and Teucer Aretaon. Ablerus fell by the spear of Nestor’s
son Antilochus, and Agamemnon, king of men, killed Elatus who dwelt in
Pedasus by the banks of the river Satnioeis. Leitus killed Phylacus as
he was flying, and Eurypylus slew Melanthius.

Then Menelaus of the loud war-cry took Adrestus alive, for his horses
ran into a tamarisk bush, as they were flying wildly over the plain,
and broke the pole from the car; they went on towards the city along
with the others in full flight, but Adrestus rolled out, and fell in the
dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot; Menelaus came up to
him spear in hand, but Adrestus caught him by the knees begging for his
life. “Take me alive,” he cried, “son of Atreus, and you shall have a
full ransom for me: my father is rich and has much treasure of gold,
bronze, and wrought iron laid by in his house. From this store he will
give you a large ransom should he hear of my being alive and at the
ships of the Achaeans.”

Thus did he plead, and Menelaus was for yielding and giving him to a
squire to take to the Achaeans’ ships, but Agamemnon came running up to
him and rebuked him. “My good Menelaus,” said he, “this is no time for
giving quarter. Has, then, your house fared so well at the hands of the
Trojans? Let us not spare a single one of them—not even the child
unborn and in its mother’s womb; let not a man of them be left alive,
but let all in Ilius perish, unheeded and forgotten.”

Thus did he speak, and his brother was persuaded by him, for his
words were just. Menelaus, therefore, thrust Adrestus from him, whereon
king Agamemnon struck him in the flank, and he fell; then the son of
Atreus planted his foot upon the breast to draw his spear from the body.
