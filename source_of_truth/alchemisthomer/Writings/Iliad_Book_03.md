# The Iliad - Book 3: The Duel between Paris and Menelaus

Now the Trojans, having armed themselves, marched in their companies with
cries and shouts like birds in the air, while the Achaeans marched silently,
breathing rage, strong in their resolve to stand by one another.

As when the south wind spreads a mist upon the mountain tops, bad for
shepherds but better than night for thieves, and a man can see no further
than he can throw a stone, even so rose the dense columns of the Trojans
and Achaeans as they marched towards one another, while the gleam of their
armor flashed in the air.

And now, as they were about to close, warlike Alexander strode in front of
the Trojans as challenger. On his shoulders he bore the skin of a panther,
his bow, and his sword; and he brandished two spears shod with bronze as a
challenge to the bravest of the Argives to meet him in single combat. Menelaus
saw him thus stride out before the ranks, and was glad as a hungry lion that
lights on the carcase of some goat or horned stag, and devours it greedily,
albeit dogs and youths set upon him. Even thus was Menelaus glad when his eyes
caught sight of Alexander, for he deemed that now he should be revenged.
Straightway he sprang from his chariot, clad in his suit of armor.

Paris quailed as he saw Menelaus come forward, and shrank in fear of his life
under cover of his men. As one who starts back affrighted, trembling and pale,
when he comes suddenly upon a serpent in some mountain glade, even so did Paris
shrink back into the throng of Trojan warriors, terror-stricken at the sight of
the son of Atreus. Then Hector upbraided him. "Paris," said he, "evil-hearted
Paris, fair to see, but woman-mad, and false of tongue, would that you had never
been born, or that you had died unwed. Better so, than live to be disgraced and
looked askance at. Will not the Achaeans mock at us and say that we have sent one
to champion us who is fair to see but a coward at heart? Did you not, such as you
are, get your following together and sail beyond the seas? Did you not from your
far country carry off a lovely woman wedded among a people of warriors- to bring
sorrow upon your father, your city, and your whole country, but joy to your enemies,
and hang-dog shamefacedness to yourself? And now can you not dare face Menelaus and
learn what kind of man it is whose wife you have stolen? Where indeed would be your
lyre and your love-tricks, your comely locks and your fair favor, when you were lying
in the dust before him? The Trojans are a weak-kneed people, or ere this you would
have had a shirt of stones for the wrongs you have done them."

And Alexander answered, "Hector, your rebuke is just; you are hard as the axe which
a shipwright wields at his work, and cleaves the timber to his liking. As the axe in
his hand, so keen is the edge of your scorn. Still, taunt me not with the gifts that
golden Venus has given me; they are precious; let not a man disdain them, for the
gods give them where they are minded, and none can have them for the asking. If you
would have me do battle with Menelaus, bid the Trojans and Achaeans take their seats,
while he and I fight in their midst for Helen and all her wealth. Let him who shall be
victorious and prove to be the better man take the woman and all she has, to bear them
to his home; but let the rest swear to a solemn covenant of peace, whereby you Trojans
shall stay here in Troy, while the Achaeans go home to Argos, and the land of the
Achaeans."
