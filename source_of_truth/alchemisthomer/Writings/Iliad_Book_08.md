# The Iliad - Book 8: The Trojans Advance to the Greek Wall

Now the dawn arose from her couch beside Tithonus, harbinger of light
alike to mortals and immortals. The gods met in council, and with them,
Jove the lord of thunder, who was chief among them. He spoke; and all
the other gods gave ear. "Hear me," said he, "gods and goddesses, that I
may speak even as I am minded; let none of you neither goddess nor god
try to cross me, but let me have my own way from henceforth. If I see
any one acting apart and helping either Trojans or Danaans, he shall be
beaten back to Olympus sorely galled, or I will hurl him down into dark
Tartarus far into the deepest pit under the earth, where the gates are
iron and the floor bronze, as far beneath Hades as heaven is high above
the earth, that you may learn how much the mightiest I am among you.
Try me and find out for yourselves. Hangs me a golden chain from heaven,
and lay hold of it all of you, gods and goddesses together- tug as you
will, you will not drag Jove the supreme counsellor from heaven to
earth; but were I to pull at it, I should draw you up with earth and sea
into the bargain, and then I would bind the chain about some pinnacle of
Olympus and leave you all dangling in the mid firmament. So far am I
above all others either of gods or men."

They were frightened and all of them of held their peace, for he had
spoken masterfully; but at last Minerva answered, "Father, son of
Saturn, king of kings, we all know that your might is not to be
gainsaid, but we are sorry for the Danaan warriors, who are perishing
and coming to a bad end. We will, however, since you so bid us, refrain
from actual fighting, but we will make serviceable suggestions to the
Argives, that they may not all of them perish in your displeasure."

Jove smiled at her and answered, "Take heart, my child, Trito-born; I
am not really in earnest, and I wish to be kind to you."

With this he yoked his fleet horses, with hoofs of bronze and manes of
glittering gold. He girded himself with gold about the body, seized his
golden whip and took his seat in his chariot. Thereon he lashed his
horses and they flew forward nothing loth midway twixt earth and sky.
After a while he reached many-fountained Ida, mother of wild beasts,
and Gargarus, where are his grove and fragrant altar. There the father
of gods and men stayed his horses, took them from the chariot, and hid
them in a thick cloud; then he took his seat all glorious upon the
topmost crests, looking down upon the city of Troy and the ships of the
Achaeans.

The Achaeans took their morning meal hastily at the ships, and
afterwards put on their armor. The Trojans on the other side armed
themselves throughout the city, fewer in numbers but nevertheless
eager perforce to do battle for their wives and children. All the
gates were flung wide open, and horse and foot sallied forth with
the tramp as of a great multitude.
