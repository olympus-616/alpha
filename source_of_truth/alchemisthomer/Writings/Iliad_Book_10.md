he is lying near our own quarters. He has no blanket
over him, nor any covering to his body. Can it be that he is one of our
captains, or one of the common soldiers? Let me go and see.”

Then he stood over him and shook him by the shoulder, and said,
“Ulysses, noble son of Laertes, wake up, and let us make the round of
the sentinels, for we do not know what may happen. The enemy is in
close proximity to our army, and we must be on our guard.”

Ulysses opened his eyes and sat up in his bed. “Noble son of Neleus,” he replied, “what is the matter now? What brings you here?”

“Trouble,” said Nestor, “is near at hand for the Achaeans. It is on your account and on account of Agamemnon that I have come to you. We must wake up all the other chieftains and hold council as to what is to be done, for we are in great peril. If we do not take measures, we shall all be doomed.”

“I am with you,” answered Ulysses, “let us go at once, and rouse all the chieftains.”

They went their way through the thick darkness, and found Diomedes and his squire in their quarters. They were both asleep under their blankets, for they were very tired with their day’s work; but Nestor roused them and said to Diomedes, “Son of Tydeus, why are you sleeping? You were not always a man to be found asleep. Are you weary with the toils of the day? Let us wake up all the chieftains and hold council as to what is to be done.”

Diomedes answered, “Noble son of Neleus, I am weary with the labours of the day. I have not had a moment’s rest since morning, and I have had many encounters with the enemy. I am therefore very tired, and would fain sleep on. But if you think it best that we should rouse the other chieftains, I will follow you.”

So they went their way and found Menelaus and Agamemnon, who were also asleep in their quarters. Nestor shook them and said, “Sons of Atreus, why are you sleeping? You were not always men to be found asleep. Are you weary with the toils of the day? Let us wake up all the other chieftains and hold council as to what is to be done, for we are in great peril. If we do not take measures, we shall all be doomed.”

Agamemnon answered, “Noble son of Neleus, I am weary with the labours of the day. I have not had a moment’s rest since morning, and I have had many encounters with the enemy. I am therefore very tired, and would fain sleep on. But if you think it best that we should rouse the other chieftains, I will follow you.”

So they went their way and found Diomedes and his squire in their quarters. They were both asleep under their blankets, for they were very tired with their day’s work; but Nestor roused them and said to Diomedes, “Son of Tydeus, why are you sleeping? You were not always a man to be found asleep. Are you weary with the toils of the day? Let us wake up all the chieftains and hold council as to what is to be done.”
