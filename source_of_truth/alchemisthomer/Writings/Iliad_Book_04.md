# The Iliad - Book 4: The Truce Broken and Agamemnon's Inspection

Now the gods sat on the golden floor beneath the roar of thunder
while the anger of Jove, who thunders on high, smote their hearts with fear.
Pallas Athena alone remained unmoved, and her eyes filled with fire
as she flashed a furious glance at her father, for she was very wroth
with him. Presently she said to him, "Father Jove, of a truth you will
soon have nothing but the dust to please you with your fire and
your lightning! You must send a message to the Trojans and Achaeans
that they are not to fight any longer but are to remain quiet,
for you have at last agreed to the prayers of the Trojans, that the
Greeks shall sack Troy without any more bloodshed."

The sire of gods and men smiled at her, and said, "My child, you do not
seem to have understood me very well; no, nor can I find fault with you,
for I have never yet deceived you in word or deed; but if you wish to see
the ruin of Troy and the Achaeans, you may send Iris to break the truce
and to inform them that the war is to be renewed."

When Pallas heard this she was glad, and she glided swiftly down from
the topmost summits of Olympus. She shot down like a star that the son
of Saturn has sent to carry a sign to mariners, or to some large army
of people, blazing as it falls, and the rays of light pour forth from
it on every side. Even so did Pallas dart down from the topmost summits
of Olympus, and she fell in the midst of them.

The truce was then broken by the cunning of the son of Saturn, who
instructed a Trojan to aim an arrow at Menelaus.

The other Trojans were consulting whether to renew the fight, or whether
to abide by the truce, when Pandarus, son of Lycaon, obeyed the order
of Jove. He took his bow, and laid it carefully on the ground before
him. He took the lid off his quiver, and took out an arrow, feathered
with the wings of a swift bird. He laid the arrow on the string, and
prayed to Apollo, the son of Jove, who loved him dearly, that he might
send it as swift as a shout of the people in assembly, and that it might
be laid low before the eyes of the Trojans. Then he drew the string and
let fly, and the arrow sped from the string on its way.

The Trojans were delighted, for they thought that the arrow had
fulfilled its purpose; but it had not killed Menelaus, and the gods
did not allow it to do so. Menelaus looked round on the Achaeans in
great anguish, as a lion looks upon the hunter who has wounded him with
an arrow. He was in great pain, but the arrow had not reached his heart.

Pallas Athena saw this and flew at once to the side of Menelaus. She
drew out the arrow, and with her hand she stopped the bleeding and
alleviated his pain. She also whispered courage into his heart, and
bade him be of good cheer.

Agamemnon was by his side at once, and gave orders to his heralds to
call the chiefs of the Achaeans to a council.

Then the heralds went their way, and presently the chieftains were
gathered in assembly. The son of Atreus rose and said, "My friends,
princes and counsellors of the Achaeans, the gods have deceived us, and
have again set us at variance with the Trojans. Tell me, then, whether
we shall abide here and renew the fight, or whether we shall go back to
our ships."
