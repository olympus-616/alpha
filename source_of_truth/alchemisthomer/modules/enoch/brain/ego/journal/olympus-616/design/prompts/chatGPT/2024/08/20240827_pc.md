Apologies for the mistake. Let me correct that:

json
Copy code
{
  "task": {
    "name": "Update Data Population Class",
    "status": "To Do",
    "project": "PCM",
    "description": "Ensure that the data population class is updated with the latest logic and configurations as per the recent requirements. This task includes reviewing existing code, implementing necessary changes, and testing to ensure accuracy and performance."
  }
}
This JSON structure should be consistent with the format we agreed upon. Please let me know if this is correct!
