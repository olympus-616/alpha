        "definition": {
            "title": "What is a Meta-Model?",
            "content": "A meta-model is a structured representation of concepts, relationships, and rules that define the framework of a mind map or system. It serves as a blueprint for organizing, managing, and evolving the underlying model. The meta-model ensures consistency, scalability, and clarity in how the mind map is developed and maintained."
        },
        "purpose": {
            "title": "Purpose of the Meta-Model",
            "content": "The meta-model provides a foundation for structuring and managing the mind map. It ensures that all nodes, relationships, tags, and documents are organized in a consistent manner. The meta-model is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the mind map, enabling scalability, and facilitating iterative updates while preserving the original structure."
        },
        "management": {
            "title": "Managing the Meta-Model",
            "content": "The meta-model is managed through strict version control, with each change documented and reviewed before implementation. Major updates introduce new concepts or significant changes, while minor updates refine existing elements. A clear versioning strategy is applied, and all changes are recorded in a change log."
        },
        "limitations": {
            "title": "Limitations of the Meta-Model",
            "content": "While the meta-model provides a robust framework for managing the mind map, it is not without limitations. These may include scalability issues as the mind map grows, performance constraints in processing large amounts of data, and potential complexity in managing extensive relationships and tags. Continuous monitoring and diagnostics are essential to address these limitations."
        },
        "futureRequirements": {
            "title": "Future Requirements and Enhancements",
            "content": "The meta-model must evolve to meet the changing needs of the system it supports. Future requirements may include the integration of new technologies, enhanced scalability solutions, more flexible tagging systems, and improved diagnostics. Regular reviews of the meta-model will identify areas for enhancement."
        },
        "versioning": {
            "title": "Version Control and Status Management",
            "content": "Each version of the meta-model is tracked with a major and minor version number. Major versions indicate significant changes, while minor versions reflect incremental updates. The status of each version is clearly marked as 'Draft' or 'Published'. Changes are only implemented after thorough review and approval."
        },
        "updateProcess": {
            "title": "Process for Updating the Meta-Model",
            "content": "Updating the meta-model involves several steps: identifying the need for change, drafting the proposed update, reviewing the draft with stakeholders, and finalizing the update by publishing the new version. The update process is designed to be iterative, with continuous feedback and refinement."
        },
        "trackingChanges": {
            "title": "Tracking and Documenting Changes",
            "content": "All changes to the meta-model are meticulously tracked. A change log records each modification, including the version number, date, and description of the change. This ensures transparency and accountability in the evolution of the meta-model."
        },
        "jsonStructureDesign": {
            "title": "Meta-Model JSON Structure Design",
            "content": "The meta-model is structured in a JSON format, organized into several high-level concepts including nodes, tags, relationships, documents, and versioning. Each of these concepts is defined with specific attributes that ensure consistency and clarity. The structure is designed to be extendable, allowing for future enhancements and scalability. The meta-meta-model governs how the meta-model itself is organized, with each component clearly defined and documented."
        },
        "proceduralGuidelines": {
            "title": "Managing Draft and Published Versions",
            "content": "All edits to the meta-model must be performed within a draft version. The draft version allows for iterative changes and feedback before finalization. Once the changes are agreed upon, the draft is reviewed by the user and, upon approval, the version is updated to 'Published'. This ensures that only finalized and approved changes are reflected in the active meta-model."
        },
        "draftToPublishedProcess": {
            "title": "Process for Moving from Draft to Published",
            "content": "1. **Draft Creation**: Any proposed changes to the meta-model are first made in a draft version. This version is labeled as 'Draft' and includes the proposed updates.\n2. **Review and Feedback**: The draft version is reviewed by all stakeholders, with feedback provided to refine and improve the proposed changes.\n3. **User Approval**: The user reviews the final draft version. If the user agrees with the changes, the draft is approved for publishing.\n4. **Publishing**: Once approved, the version number is updated, and the status is changed to 'Published'. This version becomes the active meta-model."
        }

    "agreement": {
        "title": "Agreement on Purpose and Management",
        "content": "This document serves as a formal agreement on the purpose, management, and iteration of the meta-model. Both parties agree to adhere to the guidelines set forth in this document to ensure the integrity and evolution of the mind map and its underlying structure."
