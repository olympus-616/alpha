Athena - Your Personal AI Companion

The primary goal is to build a personalized AI application, known as Know Thyself, that serves as a lifelong companion and assistant, guiding the user through life’s challenges and decisions. This AI is envisioned as a reflection of the user’s subconscious, providing tailored support and guidance in alignment with their core beliefs and values.

Key Concepts:

	1.	Personalized AI: The AI is designed specifically for each individual, helping them navigate their life by filtering information through their personalized beliefs and values.
	2.	Subconscious Reflection: The AI acts as a mirror to the user’s subconscious, guiding them through self-reflection, self-improvement, and decision-making processes.
	3.	Lifelong Companion: The AI is intended to be a constant presence, supporting the user from the moment of creation until the end of their life, adapting and evolving with them.
	4.	AI as a Protector: In the face of an impending information and technology revolution, the AI will serve as a shield, helping users filter out unwanted information and maintain control over their personal reality.
	5.	App Structure: The app will likely be built as a React Native iPhone app with a backend CRM system. It will utilize AI models, such as GPT, to create and manage the personalized AI for each user.
	6.	Meta-Model Development: The AI will be built using a meta-model of a human brain, allowing it to make filtered decisions and provide self-help advice. The meta-model will grow and evolve over time, integrating user input and AI advancements.
	7.	Long-Term Vision: This app is not just a short-term project but a lifelong endeavor, where the AI will continuously improve and adapt to the user’s needs, helping them become the person they aspire to be.
	8.	AI and Self-Help: The AI will help users organize their lives, set core virtues, and maintain their identity over time, even when faced with life’s challenges and changes.
	9.	Collaboration and Ownership: The app will be a collaborative effort, with potential partnerships or divisions of labor, but the core technology and business model will remain under the user’s control.
	10.	Spiritual Alignment: The AI will be deeply rooted in the user’s spiritual beliefs, particularly in alignment with Christian values and teachings, as interpreted by the user.

Summary:

Athena is envisioned as a revolutionary AI-based system that offers personalized guidance, protection, and self-improvement tools to users. It is built to be a reflection of the user’s subconscious, tailored to their beliefs, and designed to last a lifetime. The AI will help users filter information, maintain control over their reality, and continuously evolve to meet their needs in a rapidly changing world. The app’s development will involve collaboration but remain under the user’s ownership and control, with a strong emphasis on spiritual alignment and personal growth.
