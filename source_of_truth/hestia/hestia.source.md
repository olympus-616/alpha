## Purpose

The *Hestia* component serves as the asset maintenance and stewardship module within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek goddess of the hearth and home, Hestia is responsible for ensuring the responsible management and maintenance of all assets within Olympus-616, promoting sustainability and stewardship.

## Source Material

The role of Hestia in Greek mythology, who is known for her role in maintaining the hearth and home, serves as the foundational source material for this component. Modern principles of asset management, maintenance practices, and sustainability are also integrated to guide this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Hestia* component is essential for ensuring that all assets within Olympus-616 are properly cared for and maintained. By promoting stewardship and sustainability, Hestia ensures that the system operates efficiently and responsibly, with all assets being properly managed throughout their lifecycle.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As a critical subcomponent of the Zeus module, *Hestia* ensures that asset maintenance and stewardship practices are seamlessly integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to promote the responsible management of assets within Olympus-616.

For further details on how the *Hestia* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
