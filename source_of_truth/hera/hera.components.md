## Overview

The Hera module serves as the governance and balance of power module within Olympus-616. Named after the queen of the gods in Greek mythology, Hera is responsible for maintaining the balance of power, ensuring that governance structures within the system are fair, just, and effective. This module oversees the system’s internal and external relationships, ensuring that all interactions are governed by principles of equity and harmony.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Hera module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Governance Structures**
   - Designing and managing governance frameworks that regulate the system’s operations.
   - Ensuring that governance is transparent, fair, and accountable.

### 2. **Balance of Power**
   - Maintaining the equilibrium of power within Olympus-616, ensuring that no single component dominates the system.
   - Monitoring and adjusting power dynamics to promote harmony and prevent conflicts.

### 3. **Internal and External Relations**
   - Managing relationships within Olympus-616, as well as with external entities and systems.
   - Ensuring that all interactions align with the system’s principles of justice and equity.

### 4. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Providing mechanisms for resolving conflicts and disputes within the system.
   - Ensuring that resolutions are fair, equitable, and in line with the system’s values.

This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Hera module.
- Ensure alignment between the Hera module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
