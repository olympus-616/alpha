## Purpose

The *Hera* component oversees governance policies within Olympus-616, ensuring that power is distributed fairly and that decisions reflect fairness, justice, and balance. Named after the queen of the gods in Greek mythology, Hera is responsible for maintaining the balance of power and governance within the system.

## Source Material

The role of Hera in Greek mythology, who is known for her leadership and oversight of the pantheon, serves as the foundational source material for this component. Modern principles of governance, organizational justice, and ethical decision-making are also integrated to guide this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Hera* component is crucial for ensuring that governance within Olympus-616 is conducted fairly and justly. By overseeing the balance of power and ensuring ethical decision-making, Hera ensures that the system operates in alignment with its core values.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As part of the Zeus module, *Hera* ensures that governance and ethical principles are integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to promote fairness, justice, and balance within Olympus-616.

For further details on how the *Hera* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
