## Overview

This document serves as a formalized architecture record for the Zeus module within Olympus-616. It lists and describes all components under the jurisdiction of Zeus, the system architecture and orchestration module. This document will be continuously updated as new components are added or existing components are modified, ensuring a clear and organized structure of the system’s architecture.

## Components Overview

Each component in Olympus-616 is designed to be capable of local, cloud, hybrid, or hosted deployment. Each component should eventually be able to make that choice independently without impacting any other module outside its own jurisdiction. The parent component defines the child component, and the child component references the parent component at all times to establish a strict ruleset built directly into the code.

This document serves as the authority for all components in the system, as they all descend from this component architecture. This component list also includes documentation and reference to the rest of Olympus-616 that cannot be captured within the parent/child relationship of components.

## Component Relationship

Each component within Olympus-616 will define its source of truth within its own `[module].source.md` file. This file contains both the parent architecture as well as any reference material or influences that should be considered within the evolution of that particular component. The parent `[module].component` is ultimately responsible for the inception, realization, and eradication of any outputs from its components. Child components must reference their architectural owner, which defines their purpose and scope, ensuring alignment with the overarching system architecture.

## Components

This is the official list of components within Olympus-616. Zeus manages the architecture and the connections between all components. Zeus is the orchestrator of the entire Olympus-616 and whatever shape it takes, both within this repository and in the full karmic impact of this project’s inception, realization, deprecation, and destruction.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a module or component no longer serves a clear purpose or its purpose is absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation in both its design document and the parent component’s components list. This ensures that all code and modules within Olympus-616 are purposeful and contribute to the system’s overall goals. We aim for zero technical debt, and similarly, we desire zero over-engineering or under-utilization of overly complex solutions.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to include new components or modifications to existing components.
- Ensure that each component is clearly described, with its role within the Zeus module and Olympus-616 as a whole.
- Use this document as a reference when making architectural decisions or modifications.
