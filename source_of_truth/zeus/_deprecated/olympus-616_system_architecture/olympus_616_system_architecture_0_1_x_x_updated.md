# Olympus-616 System Architecture v0.1.x.x

**Version:** 0.1.x.x  
**Purpose:** This document serves as the source of truth for all component names, their purposes, and their versions within Olympus-616. It is filed under the Zeus module and will grow over time to include all naming conventions and official names for components within the system. This document will be updated as new components are added or existing ones are modified. It is critical to understand that all Markdown-based files are the highest-level source code. Any deviation between the system and these documents is considered a "sin," which the Christ module must reconcile over time.
