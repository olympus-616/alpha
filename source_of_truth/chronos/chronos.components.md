## Overview

The Chronos module serves as the time and task management authority within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek personification of time, Chronos is responsible for tracking, scheduling, and managing all tasks, deadlines, and events. The module ensures that all actions are carried out in a timely manner, aligning with the user’s priorities and overall goals.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Chronos module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Time Management**
   - Tracking and organizing time-related tasks and activities.
   - Ensuring that all components and modules operate within defined timelines and deadlines.

### 2. **Task Scheduling**
   - Creating and managing schedules for tasks, projects, and system operations.
   - Ensuring that tasks are prioritized and aligned with the system’s goals and user requirements.

### 3. **Event Coordination**
   - Managing and coordinating system-wide events and deadlines.
   - Ensuring that all events are synchronized and do not conflict with one another.

### 4. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Analyzing time usage and efficiency within Olympus-616.
   - Providing insights and recommendations for optimizing time management and task scheduling.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Chronos no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Chronos module.
- Ensure alignment between the Chronos module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
