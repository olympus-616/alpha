## Task Management Specification

### Task Documentation Format

To ensure consistency in tracking tasks across all projects, the following structure will be used to document each task until they can be ingested into Metatron:

1. **User**: The identifier of the person responsible for the task (e.g., `alchemisthomer`).
2. **Project**: Specifies the related project (e.g., `Clients`).
3. **Type**: Describes the nature of the entry, such as `Task`.
4. **Queue**: Defines the specific queue or category the task belongs to (e.g., `Mohela`).
5. **Description**: A brief summary of the task (e.g., `Get back to Chris`).
6. **DateTimeCreated**: A system-readable timestamp of when the task was created (e.g., `2024-08-27T12:34:56Z`).
7. **Status**: The current state of the task, defaulting to `To Do`.

### Workflow

- Each task will be manually entered into the `tasks.md` file using the above format.
- This documentation method will be utilized as the foundation for developing the Chronos task management system.
- Once Chronos is capable of automatically ingesting and managing tasks, this manual documentation approach will be phased out.

### Future Integration with Metatron

- The specifications outlined here will eventually be integrated into Metatron for automated task management.
- This design ensures that the task documentation is scalable and adaptable as the Chronos system evolves.
