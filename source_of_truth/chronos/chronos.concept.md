# Kronos BPM High-Level Business Requirements Design Document

## Overview
Kronos BPM is a dynamic business process and project management system that integrates features of tools like Asana and Jira, enhanced by a transactional database and logic-driven workflow automation. The core goal of Kronos BPM is to allow users to manage and optimize business processes in a modular, automated, and data-driven way. This system provides flexibility by breaking down workflows into manageable components while maintaining the ability to track and improve processes over time.

## Key Features
1. **Swim Lanes & Team Assignment**: 
   - Each project consists of multiple swim lanes, which act as virtual teams.
   - Users are assigned to swim lanes through their association with the project.
   - Swim lanes define roles, responsibilities, and eligibility for tasks.
   - Team members can assign tasks to themselves from the swim lane.

2. **Task Lifecycle Management**:
   - Tasks move through a defined lifecycle both within the swim lane and the overall project.
   - Dynamic logic is triggered as tasks transition through different lifecycle stages.
   - Each stage can initiate specific workflows based on the status of the task, supporting both individual and bulk operations.

3. **Workflow Automation**:
   - Automated processes can be built into each transition step of the task lifecycle.
   - System events can trigger automated actions such as notifications, status updates, or database interactions.
   - Workflows can be decoupled and modularized, allowing specific logic to be injected into stages as needed.

4. **Bulk-Safe Architecture**:
   - The system is designed to handle bulk processing safely and efficiently.
   - Tasks and workflows are marshaled in a way that ensures they can be executed in a scalable and controlled manner.
   - The architecture ensures that workflow handlers are executed properly, even in bulk processing scenarios, while adhering to system limits.

5. **Dynamic Project Hydration**:
   - Projects are defined through a JSON-based project configuration file, allowing for flexible setup.
   - A project contains all the necessary metadata to "hydrate" the system, dynamically creating the workflows, logic, and user interfaces required for the task.
   - This configuration-driven approach enables seamless automation and dynamic behavior within the project.

6. **UML BPM Notation Support**:
   - The system supports UML Business Process Model (BPM) notation, allowing users to design complex processes graphically.
   - These BPM models can be transcribed into project definitions, providing a blueprint for workflow automation.
   - The project definition file contains all necessary information to automate processes, track task progress, and provide reporting.

7. **Task Object Association**:
   - Tasks can be associated with custom Salesforce objects (`SObjects`, `RFObjects`, etc.) at specific stages in the lifecycle.
   - Based on task rules, Salesforce metadata or custom metadata models dynamically generate the relevant data pages and records.
   - This allows seamless integration with existing Salesforce data models, enabling the flow of custom objects through the project lifecycle.

8. **Comprehensive Metrics Tracking**:
   - The system tracks detailed metrics for each task, including time in queue, time assigned, time in progress, and overall cycle time within a project.
   - This data is used to identify inefficiencies and bottlenecks, providing insights for process optimization.
   - A data management layer will support intelligent reporting and allow users to make informed decisions about process improvements.

## Benefits
- **Modularity**: The system breaks workflows into manageable chunks that can be tailored to specific business needs.
- **Flexibility**: Processes can be defined dynamically through JSON, UML BPM notation, and Salesforce metadata, allowing for a wide range of customization.
- **Automation**: Automation can be easily integrated at each stage of the workflow, reducing manual overhead and improving efficiency.
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: Comprehensive metrics allow for continuous process improvement by tracking performance and identifying areas for optimization.

## Use Case Example
An admin defines a business process as a project in Kronos BPM. The project definition includes the swim lanes, task life cycles, and dynamic workflows. As tasks are created, they move through different life cycle stages, triggering automation based on the business logic defined. Tasks are associated with Salesforce objects (e.g., Opportunity IDs or Case IDs) and the system dynamically generates UI elements and data records based on these objects. Throughout the process, metrics are tracked to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the process over time.

## Pros and Cons
### Pros:
- **Highly Configurable**: The system allows for flexible project and process configuration through JSON and metadata models.
- **Bulk Processing Support**: Built to handle bulk task operations efficiently and safely.
- **Integrated Automation**: Automated workflows can be seamlessly incorporated at any stage of the task lifecycle.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The system supports ongoing process refinement through metrics and reporting.

### Cons:
- **Complexity**: The flexibility of the system may require a learning curve for users unfamiliar with dynamic workflow automation.
- **Dependence on Salesforce Integration**: The system is tightly integrated with Salesforce, and custom objects or data types may require additional configuration.

## Patent Opportunities
The following elements of Kronos BPM represent innovative opportunities for patent exploration:
1. **Dynamic Workflow Injection**: The ability to inject business logic into modular workflow stages, including task lifecycle transitions.
2. **Automated Project Hydration**: A process for dynamically hydrating project configurations using JSON or other metadata models.
3. **Bulk-Safe Architecture**: A bulk-safe method of managing and executing workflows in large-scale, transactional systems.
4. **UML BPM Transcription**: The transcription of UML BPM models into functional project definitions for automation purposes.
5. **Comprehensive Metrics and Process Optimization**: A system that tracks detailed process metrics and provides real-time insights for optimization and continuous improvement.

## Operational Plan

1. **Phase 1: Process Definition & Setup**
   - Develop the ability for admins to define projects and processes using JSON, UML BPM notation, or metadata models.
   - Implement the architecture for swim lanes and dynamic workflow injection.

2. **Phase 2: Task Creation & Tracking**
   - Build the interface for task creation, movement through lifecycles, and assignment within swim lanes.
   - Integrate Salesforce objects dynamically based on the task stage.

3. **Phase 3: Workflow Automation**
   - Introduce the ability to define logic and automation at various stages of the workflow.
   - Implement bulk-safe task processing and workflow handling.

4. **Phase 4: Metrics & Reporting**
   - Develop the metrics tracking system to monitor task lifecycle times and identify bottlenecks.
   - Build reporting tools to analyze process efficiency and guide optimization efforts.

5. **Phase 5: Continuous Improvement**
   - Implement the feedback loop that allows process redefinition and optimization based on metrics.
   - Build additional automation capabilities into the system as areas of inefficiency are identified.
