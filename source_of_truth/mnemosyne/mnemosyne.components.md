## Overview

The Mnemosyne module serves as the memory and caching layer within Olympus-616, representing the non-persisted data collection similar to a caching cluster or memory layer, akin to Redis. Named after the Titaness of memory in Greek mythology, Mnemosyne symbolizes the ephemeral and powerful memory cache, where data is stored temporarily to speed up processes and provide quick access to critical information. This memory is essential for fast processing yet is volatile and must be carefully managed.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Mnemosyne module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Memory Caching**
   - Managing non-persisted data within Olympus-616, providing a fast and efficient memory cache for critical operations.
   - Ensuring that cached data is accurate, up-to-date, and accessible when needed.

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enhancing system performance by reducing latency and speeding up data retrieval through effective caching strategies.
   - Implementing caching mechanisms that balance speed and resource utilization.

### 3. **Data Volatility Management**
   - Managing the volatility of cached data, ensuring that essential information is preserved while unnecessary data is purged.
   - Implementing strategies to recover or regenerate cached data in case of system failure or data loss.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that caching strategies align with the broader goals of Olympus-616.
   - Harmonizing memory and caching operations with the systemâ€™s overall architecture and data management practices.

## Components Overview

The Mnemosyne module oversees several components that facilitate its responsibilities within Olympus-616. Each component is designed to ensure the module's responsibilities are met without compromising the system's integrity.

## Components

   **Status:** Active

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Mnemosyne no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Mnemosyne module.
- Ensure alignment between the Mnemosyne module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
