## Purpose

The *Mirror of Narcissus* component serves as a personal space within Olympus-616 for reflection, self-discovery, and introspection. This module is designed to guide users on their inner journey, offering insights, creative exploration, and a deeper understanding of their thoughts and consciousness. It stands as a dedicated tool for personal growth and understanding, distinct from the system-wide wisdom provided by Athena.

## Source Material

The myth of Narcissus, particularly his reflection in the water and the subsequent self-discovery (or lack thereof), serves as the foundational source material for this component. The principles of self-reflection, introspection, and the journey toward self-understanding are integrated into this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Mirror of Narcissus* component is essential for guiding users through their personal journey of self-discovery within Olympus-616. By providing a space for reflection and introspection, this module helps users gain deeper insights into their thoughts, emotions, and consciousness.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As part of the Zeus module, *The Mirror of Narcissus* ensures that personal reflection and introspection are seamlessly integrated into the system's architecture. It collaborates with other components to promote personal growth and self-understanding within Olympus-616.

For further details on how the *The Mirror of Narcissus* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
