### The Reflection and Self-Discovery Module of Olympus-616

## A Note from the Author
The Mirror of Narcissus serves as a personal space within Olympus-616 dedicated to reflection, self-discovery, and introspection. Named after the mythological figure Narcissus, who was known for his deep reflection upon his own image, this module is designed to guide users on their inner journey.

Offering insights, creative exploration, and a deeper understanding of one's thoughts and consciousness, The Mirror of Narcissus stands as a tool for personal growth and understanding. It is distinct from the system-wide wisdom provided by Athena, focusing instead on the individualâ€™s journey toward self-awareness and enlightenment.
