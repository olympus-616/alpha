## Overview

The Mirror of Narcissus module serves as a personal space within Olympus-616 for reflection, self-discovery, and introspection. Named after the mythological figure Narcissus, who became entranced by his own reflection, this module is designed to guide users on their inner journey. It offers insights, creative exploration, and a deeper understanding of their thoughts and consciousness. The Mirror of Narcissus stands as a dedicated tool for personal growth and understanding, distinct from the system-wide wisdom provided by Athena.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Mirror of Narcissus module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Reflection and Introspection**
   - Providing a space for users to reflect on their thoughts, emotions, and experiences.
   - Encouraging deep introspection and self-discovery.

### 2. **Personal Growth**
   - Supporting users in their journey of personal growth and understanding.
   - Offering tools and insights to help users explore their consciousness and identity.

### 3. **Creative Exploration**
   - Encouraging creative exploration and expression as part of the introspective journey.
   - Providing resources and prompts that inspire creativity and self-expression.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that insights gained from introspection are integrated into the broader system.
   - Harmonizing the personal growth and understanding fostered by this module with the wisdom of Athena and the guidance of other modules.
