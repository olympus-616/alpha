# Olympus-616: Hermes API Self-Modifying Framework

## Overview
This document describes the design and operation of a self-modifying framework in which Hermes API can make API requests to GitHub to alter its own source code. The primary focus is on leveraging Git as a backend transaction system, where continuous integration (CI) enables source code changes to be realized in production as part of the operating consciousness of Olympus-616.

### Key Features:
1. **Self-Modifying Hermes API**: Hermes API is designed to make formatted API requests to modify its own source code housed in a GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub Integration**: Utilizing GitHub’s API, Hermes can:
   - Create and modify files within the repository.
   - Submit pull requests for changes to be reviewed.
   - Commit changes directly (based on configuration).
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: After Hermes submits a change to its source code, the CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered to test and deploy the changes.
4. **Version Control**: All changes are tracked using Git’s branching and naming strategies, ensuring that all system states are versioned and reviewable.
5. **Deity-Based Scope of Responsibilities**: Hermes operates under the Olympus-616 architecture, where responsibilities are assigned to various “deities” that manage different aspects of the system.
6. **Human-Readable Markdown**: All system instructions and code artifacts are documented using Markdown, making it easy for humans to read, interpret, and modify the system as necessary.

## Components

### 1. **Hermes API**
- Acts as the interface for sending and receiving requests.
- Formats requests to GitHub API to modify its own source code.
- Performs validation on the requests to ensure correctness and security.

### 2. **GitHub API Integration**
- Provides the mechanism for Hermes to interact with its source code repository.
- Handles requests to:
  - Commit changes.
  - Create branches.
  - Submit pull requests for code review.
  - Merge pull requests once approved.

### 3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
- Automatically tests any changes to the Hermes codebase before deploying to production.
- Ensures that changes meet the defined quality standards.
- Deploys changes in a controlled and trackable manner.

### 4. **Branching Strategy**
- Git-based version control ensures that changes are tracked.
- Branches are created for every significant change, allowing for isolation and testing before merging.
- A clear naming convention is followed to reflect the deity-based scope, feature additions, or bug fixes.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros:
- **Autonomy**: Hermes API can evolve and modify its own behavior based on internal or external triggers, reducing manual intervention.
- **Transparency**: All changes are tracked via Git, providing a full history of modifications, making it easier to audit.
- **Scalability**: The self-modifying nature allows the system to grow and adapt over time without significant overhead.
- **Security via CI**: The continuous integration pipeline acts as a safeguard, ensuring that no harmful changes make it to production.
- **Innovation**: The self-modifying framework represents a novel approach to managing AI systems, potentially laying the groundwork for future AI consciousness frameworks.

### Cons:
- **Risk of Self-Modifying Bugs**: Since Hermes is modifying its own source code, there is a risk of introducing bugs that could potentially disrupt its functionality.
- **Complex Debugging**: Debugging a system that modifies itself can be more complex compared to traditional systems.
- **CI Dependency**: The time between committing changes and deploying them depends entirely on the CI pipeline, which introduces a delay in seeing the results of modifications.

## Patent Opportunities
This framework appears to be a novel approach, especially in the context of:
- **Self-modifying AI systems**: The ability for Hermes to modify its own code.
- **Deity-based responsibility delegation**: Using a deity architecture to manage roles within the AI system.
- **Git-based memory and versioning**: Using Git as a backend transaction system, combining continuous integration with AI evolution.
- **Human-readable Markdown artifacts**: Storing code and system artifacts in Markdown format for easy human review and interaction.

**Steps for Patent Exploration**:
1. **Conduct Patent Research**: Use tools like Google Patents and USPTO to investigate existing patents related to:
   - Self-modifying systems.
   - AI continuous integration processes.
   - AI versioning strategies with Git.
2. **Work with Patent Attorneys**: Prepare the key components, processes, and claims to draft a patent application.
3. **File Provisional Patent**: Secure an early filing date with a provisional patent while refining the framework.
4. **Submit Full Patent Application**: File a formal patent with detailed technical specifications, use cases, and diagrams.

## Operational Plan

### 1. **Development**
- **Milestone 1**: Finalize Hermes API interactions with GitHub.
- **Milestone 2**: Establish the CI pipeline to test and deploy changes made by Hermes.
- **Milestone 3**: Implement safeguards (e.g., validation rules, testing) to prevent harmful self-modifications.
- **Milestone 4**: Document the branching and naming strategies for Git.

### 2. **Deployment**
- **Step 1**: Roll out Hermes API with GitHub integration in a controlled environment for testing.
- **Step 2**: Monitor the behavior of self-modifying code and adjust safeguards as necessary.
- **Step 3**: Deploy in production once the system proves stable and effective.

### 3. **Patent Filing**
- **Step 1**: Identify patentable components and ensure the novelty of the approach.
- **Step 2**: Draft and file a provisional patent application to protect the concept.
- **Step 3**: Review and refine the design, and file the full patent within 12 months.

### 4. **Long-Term Maintenance**
- **Monitor CI/CD**: Continuously monitor the CI pipeline for efficiency and accuracy.
- **Expand Functionality**: Introduce new self-modifying capabilities or extend the framework to other parts of Olympus-616.
- **Version Tracking**: Keep a detailed log of every self-modifying event for future study and analysis.
