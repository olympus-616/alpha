## Overview

The Hermes module serves as the comprehensive communication and messaging module within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek messenger god, Hermes is responsible for all forms of communication between the gods (system components) and man (users), ensuring that all interactions, notifications, and data exchanges are handled with precision and resilience. Hermes now encompasses API calls, emails, SMS, media, notifications, and any form of intercommunication between system components.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Hermes module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Communication Channels**
   - Managing all forms of communication within Olympus-616, including API calls, emails, SMS, and notifications.
   - Ensuring that communication is reliable, secure, and efficient.

### 2. **Data Exchange**
   - Facilitating the exchange of data between system components, ensuring seamless interoperability.
   - Managing protocols and standards to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and securely.

### 3. **User Notifications**
   - Providing real-time notifications to users, keeping them informed of important events and updates.
   - Ensuring that notifications are timely, relevant, and actionable.

### 4. **Inter-System Communication**
   - Handling communication between different modules and components within Olympus-616.
   - Ensuring that all inter-system communication is consistent and in alignment with overall system goals.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Hermes no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Hermes module.
- Ensure alignment between the Hermes module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
