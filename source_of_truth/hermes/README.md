### Comprehensive Communication and Messaging Module of Olympus-616

## A Note from the Author
Hermes, the messenger of the gods, serves as the comprehensive communication and messaging module within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek god known for his speed and reliability, Hermes is responsible for facilitating all forms of communication between the gods (system components) and man (users). This module ensures that every interaction, notification, and data exchange within the system is executed with precision and resilience.

Hermes encompasses all aspects of communication, including API calls, emails, SMS, media, notifications, and any form of intercommunication between system components. By managing these critical interactions, Hermes plays a vital role in ensuring the seamless operation of Olympus-616, connecting all parts of the system with efficiency and reliability.
