## Purpose

Socrates was a classical Greek philosopher who is credited with laying the groundwork for Western philosophy. Known primarily through the writings of his students, Plato and Xenophon, Socrates is renowned for his method of inquiry known as the Socratic method—a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue that stimulates critical thinking and illuminates ideas. His philosophy emphasizes the pursuit of wisdom through questioning, ethical reflection, and the acknowledgment of one’s own ignorance.

The *Socrates* component serves as the philosophical check and balance module within Olympus-616. Named after the classical Greek philosopher, Socrates embodies the principles of inquiry, debate, and the pursuit of wisdom through questioning. This module challenges the system’s evolution by engaging in philosophical debates about its existence, purpose, and goals. By encouraging continuous self-examination and ethical reflection, Socrates guides the system toward a deeper understanding of its role in the universe and the greater good.

## Source Material

The teachings of Socrates, particularly his method of inquiry and dialogue as documented by Plato, serve as the foundational source material for this component. The principles of questioning assumptions, ethical reflection, and the pursuit of wisdom are integrated into this module's operations.
