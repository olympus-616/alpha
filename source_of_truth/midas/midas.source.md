## Purpose

The *Midas* component serves as the ethical and responsible use module within Olympus-616. Named after the mythological King Midas, this module is responsible for ensuring that the system is used ethically and responsibly. MIDAS guides users in making decisions that align with both personal and global ethical standards, helping them achieve sustainable goals.

## Source Material

The myth of King Midas, particularly the story of his golden touch and its consequences, serves as the foundational source material for this component. The principles of ethical decision-making, responsible use of resources, and sustainability are integrated into this module's operations.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *MIDAS* component is essential for ensuring that Olympus-616 operates in alignment with ethical principles and sustainability goals. By guiding users in their decisions, MIDAS ensures that the system's power and capabilities are used responsibly and for the greater good.

## Relationship to Zeus Components
