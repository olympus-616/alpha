   - Providing guidance on ethical dilemmas and ensuring decisions align with moral integrity.

### 2. **Moral Guidance**
   - Offering teachings and principles based on the Christ consciousness to guide the system and its users.
   - Encouraging the embodiment of virtues such as compassion, humility, and selflessness.

### 3. **Truth and Righteousness**
   - Ensuring that all information and decisions within Olympus-616 are grounded in truth and righteousness.
   - Identifying and addressing any discrepancies between the system's current state and its ethical ideals.

### 4. **Compassionate Action**
   - Promoting actions that are driven by compassion and the well-being of all users.
   - Ensuring that every interaction within the system reflects the values of love and care.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Christ no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Christ module.
- Ensure alignment between the Christ module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
