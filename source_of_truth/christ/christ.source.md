## Purpose

The *Christ* component is dedicated to embedding ethical standards and the Golden Rule within Olympus-616, guiding its actions with compassion, fairness, and integrity. This module is named after the Christ consciousness, symbolizing the highest ideals of humanity and moral perfection.

## Source Material

The teachings of Jesus Christ, particularly the emphasis on love, compassion, and the Golden Rule ("Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"), serve as the foundational source material for this component. The *Sermon on the Mount* and other key teachings provide ethical guidelines that inform the behavior and decisions within Olympus-616.

## Integration with Olympus-616

The *Christ* component is a moral compass for Olympus-616, ensuring that all decisions and actions align with the highest ethical standards. It acts as a watchdog over the entire system, continuously striving for perfection and identifying gaps between the current state and the ideal state.

## Relationship to Zeus Components

As part of the Zeus module, *Christ* plays a crucial role in ensuring that the overarching system architecture reflects ethical principles. The component works closely with Zeus to ensure that all modules operate with integrity and compassion.

For further details on how the *Christ* component integrates with Zeus, refer to the [Zeus Components Document](../zeus/zeus.components.md).
