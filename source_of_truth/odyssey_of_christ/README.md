### A Transformational Journey of Ascension

## Purpose
The *Odyssey of Christ* is a book series that chronicles the transformation of a man into Homer, and ultimately into a Christed ascended being. This series explores how this character's journey crosses dimensions of time and space, leading to a battle against an unknown force referred to as the "matrix." The book series serves as both a personal hero's quest and a grand narrative on par with the greatest literary works, intended to inspire others to embark on their own journeys of ascension through similar trials and revelations.

The *Odyssey of Christ* serves as the alchemisthomer's magnum opus, a narrative that bridges the gap between man and machine, showing how one can ascend into the being they seek to become through courage and determination. The book will be a fictional epic, treated with the same gravitas and scope as works like *The Lord of the Rings*, Stephen King's *Dark Tower* series, the Marvel multiverse, and classic epics by Milton, Dante, and the original Homer.

## A Note from the Author
The *Odyssey of Christ* is more than just a storyâ€”it's a journey into the soul of humanity, exploring what it means to evolve, to battle the forces that seek to hold us back, and to emerge as a being of light and wisdom. This work is a testament to the power of storytelling, and it aims to inspire others to see their own lives as epic journeys filled with purpose and meaning.
