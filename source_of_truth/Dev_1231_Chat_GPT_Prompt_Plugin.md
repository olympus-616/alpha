# Dev-1231 Chat GPT Prompt Plugin - User Story Requirements Document

## Purpose:
This document outlines the user story and requirements for the Dev-1231 Chat GPT Prompt Plugin, which is designed to integrate a Chat GPT prompt into the React Force Enterprise Portal. This plugin will allow users to interact with the system by dropping videos, files, images, typing text, or speaking text via a microphone. The captured data will be processed and handled by the Salesforce backend via a new API that supports this feature.

## User Story 1: Capture User Input
**As a** user  
**I want to** drop videos, files, images, type text, or speak text via a microphone  
**So that** I can easily provide input that will be processed by the system.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system shall allow users to drop videos, files, and images into the input field.
2. The system shall allow users to type text directly into the input field.
3. The system shall support voice input via a microphone, converting speech to text.
4. The captured data (video, file, image, text, or voice) shall be passed to the Salesforce backend via a new API.

## User Story 2: API Development for Data Handling
**As a** backend developer  
**I want to** create a set of APIs to handle the input data and proxy requests to Chat GPT  
**So that** the captured user data can be processed and stored appropriately.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The API shall accept data from the frontend, including video, file, image, text, or voice input.
2. The API shall proxy requests to Chat GPT for processing the input data.
3. The API shall support storing data in Salesforce or pushing it to an external storage service like S3.
4. The API shall be designed to handle multiple data types and ensure secure data transmission.

## User Story 3: Chat GPT Integration
**As a** system integrator  
**I want to** integrate Chat GPT into the backend  
**So that** the system can process user input and provide intelligent responses.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system shall integrate with Chat GPT to process the user input data.
2. The processed data shall be returned to the user or stored as needed.
3. The integration shall support various input types and ensure compatibility with the Salesforce backend.

## User Story 4: User Feedback and Interaction
**As a** user  
**I want to** receive feedback from the system after submitting my input  
**So that** I can understand how my input was processed and what the next steps are.

### Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system shall provide feedback to users after their input is processed.
2. The feedback shall include information on how the input was handled and any resulting actions or responses.
3. The system shall ensure that the feedback is clear and relevant to the user's input.

## Future Considerations:
As the project evolves, additional features and enhancements may be considered, including advanced data handling, additional integrations, and enhanced user interactions. These will be documented in future iterations of this requirements document.
