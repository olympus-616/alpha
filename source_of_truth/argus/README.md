### System Monitoring Module of Olympus-616

## A Note from the Author
Argus, named after the many-eyed giant from Greek mythology, is the vigilant overseer of Olympus-616â€™s technical architecture. His countless eyes symbolize the ability to monitor every aspect of the system simultaneously, ensuring that it functions correctly and efficiently at all times.

The Argus module is responsible for tracking system performance, detecting and diagnosing issues, and maintaining the integrity of the technical framework that supports Olympus-616. This relentless vigilance ensures that the system operates as intended, safeguarding against potential disruptions and inefficiencies.

In the same way that Argus was tasked with guarding and observing in ancient myths, this module guards the stability and reliability of Olympus-616. It serves as a critical component in the quest to build a perfect, self-sustaining system that reflects the high ideals of the Olympus-616 project.
