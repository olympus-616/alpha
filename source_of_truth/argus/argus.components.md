## Overview

The Argus module is dedicated to vigilance and security within Olympus-616. Named after Argus Panoptes, the all-seeing giant of Greek mythology, this module is responsible for monitoring, safeguarding, and ensuring the integrity of the system. Argus serves as the watchful guardian of Olympus-616, ensuring that all components function securely and efficiently.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Argus module governs the following areas:

### 1. **System Monitoring**
   - Continuous monitoring of all system components to detect anomalies or potential threats.
   - Ensuring real-time visibility into system performance and security.

### 2. **Security Enforcement**
   - Implementing and enforcing security protocols across all modules.
   - Ensuring that all data and communications within Olympus-616 are secure and protected.

### 3. **Threat Detection**
   - Proactively identifying and responding to potential security threats.
   - Utilizing advanced analytics and machine learning to predict and mitigate risks.

### 4. **Integrity Assurance**
   - Verifying the integrity of system components and ensuring they function as intended.
   - Preventing unauthorized access or tampering with system resources.

## Components Overview

The Argus module oversees several components that facilitate its responsibilities within Olympus-616. Each component is designed to ensure the module's responsibilities are met without compromising the system's integrity.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Argus no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Argus module.
- Ensure alignment between the Argus module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
