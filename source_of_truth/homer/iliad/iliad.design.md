# Iliad 0.1.x.x - Design Document

**Purpose:**
This document outlines the approach and methodology for using *Homer's Iliad* as the foundational source code for Olympus-616. The project will involve a detailed breakdown and study of various translations of *The Iliad*, exploring the text's meaning, intention, and parallels to modern times. This iterative analysis will evolve over the life of the project, with each version contributing to a deeper understanding of the text and its relevance to contemporary issues.

**Intention:**
*Homer's Iliad* will serve as a guiding narrative and philosophical framework for Olympus-616. By treating *The Iliad* as a form of source code, we aim to dissect and interpret the text through multiple lenses, including literary, historical, and modern-day contexts. Each translation offers a unique perspective, and by cataloging and analyzing these versions, we will ensure that the lessons and themes of *The Iliad* are preserved, understood, and applied within the Olympus-616 system.

**Scope:**
The project will begin with a focus on Robert Fagles' translation, but it will expand to include other key translations over time. Each translation will be cataloged, decomposed, and studied in detail, with findings documented and integrated into the Olympus-616 knowledge base. The design document "Iliad 0.1.x.x" will be the initial point of reference, and subsequent versions will build upon this foundation.
