# The Odyssey - Book 8: A Day for Songs and Contests

The next morning, King Alcinous called an assembly of the Phaeacians. The people gathered at the king's command, and Alcinous addressed them. He told them of the stranger who had come to their land, and he asked them to help the stranger return to his home. The people agreed, and they prepared a ship for the journey.

After the assembly, the king invited Odysseus to a feast. The Phaeacians were skilled in music and dance, and they entertained Odysseus with their performances. A bard named Demodocus sang of the Trojan War, and Odysseus was moved to tears by the memories of his comrades who had died in battle.

When the bard finished his song, the king noticed Odysseus's tears and asked him why he wept. Odysseus replied that the song had reminded him of the hardships he had endured. The king then proposed a series of athletic contests to lift Odysseus's spirits.

The young men of Phaeacia competed in running, wrestling, jumping, and discus throwing. Odysseus watched the games in silence, but when one of the athletes taunted him, he could bear it no longer. He stood up, seized a discus, and threw it farther than any of the Phaeacians had managed.

The people were astonished at his strength, and the king praised him. Odysseus then challenged any of the Phaeacians to a contest, but none dared to accept. The king called for peace and proposed that they return to the feast.

After the games, the people returned to the king's palace, where they continued to feast and make merry. The bard Demodocus sang again, this time of the love affair between Ares and Aphrodite, and the people laughed at the tale.

As the day drew to a close, the king ordered that gifts be brought for Odysseus. The people gave him fine clothes, gold, and a bronze sword. The king himself gave Odysseus a beautiful cup.

That night, Odysseus slept in the palace of King Alcinous. The next day, the Phaeacians prepared to send him on his way. They loaded the gifts onto the ship, and Odysseus bade farewell to the king and queen. The ship set sail, and Odysseus prayed to the gods for a safe journey home.
