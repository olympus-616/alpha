# The Odyssey - Book 9: In the One-Eyed Giant’s Cave

Odysseus begins to tell the tale of his adventures since leaving Troy. After leaving Troy, his fleet was blown off course, first to the land of the Cicones, where his men plundered the city until they were driven back to their ships by the Cicones’ reinforcements. From there, they were blown to the land of the Lotus-eaters, where some of his men ate the lotus, which made them forget their homes and long to stay in the land of the Lotus-eaters forever.

Odysseus forced his men back to the ships and sailed on until they reached the land of the Cyclopes. They found a cave full of cheese and sheep and decided to wait for the owner to return. When the Cyclops Polyphemus returned, he trapped Odysseus and his men in the cave by blocking the entrance with a huge stone. Polyphemus ate two of Odysseus's men for his supper, and then he fell asleep.

The next day, Polyphemus ate two more men for breakfast, and Odysseus realized that he had to come up with a plan to escape. He sharpened a wooden stake and hardened it in the fire, then he and his men waited for Polyphemus to return.

When Polyphemus returned, Odysseus offered him wine, which he drank, and then Odysseus told him that his name was "Nobody." When Polyphemus fell asleep, Odysseus and his men drove the stake into the Cyclops’s eye, blinding him. Polyphemus cried out in pain, but when the other Cyclopes came to his cave to ask what was wrong, he told them that "Nobody" was hurting him, so they left him alone.

The next morning, Odysseus tied his men to the undersides of Polyphemus's sheep, and when Polyphemus let the sheep out to graze, Odysseus and his men escaped. As they sailed away, Odysseus taunted Polyphemus, who threw huge rocks at the ship, nearly sinking it. Polyphemus prayed to his father, Poseidon, to curse Odysseus and ensure that he never reached home.

# The Odyssey - Book 10: The Bewitching Queen of Aeaea

Odysseus and his men reached the island of Aeaea, home of the witch-goddess Circe. Circe turned Odysseus’s men into pigs, but Hermes gave Odysseus a magical herb called moly, which protected him from Circe’s spells. When Circe tried to turn Odysseus into a pig, the moly protected him, and he forced her to change his men back into their human forms.

Odysseus and his men stayed with Circe for a year, feasting and enjoying her hospitality, until his men finally convinced him to continue their journey home. Circe told Odysseus that he must visit the land of the dead and consult the prophet Tiresias before he could return to Ithaca.

Odysseus and his men sailed to the western edge of the world, to the land of the Cimmerians, where they performed the rituals Circe had instructed them to do. The spirits of the dead gathered around them, and Tiresias came forward to tell Odysseus that Poseidon would make his journey home difficult, but that he would eventually return to Ithaca if he avoided the cattle of the sun god, Helios.

Tiresias also told Odysseus that he would find trouble in his home, and that he would have to travel to a distant land to make a sacrifice to Poseidon before he could live out his life in peace.

# The Odyssey - Book 11: The Kingdom of the Dead

Odysseus continues his tale, describing his journey to the land of the dead. There he speaks with the spirits of the dead, including his mother, Anticleia, who tells him of the troubles in Ithaca, and Agamemnon, who tells him of his murder at the hands of Aegisthus and Clytemnestra.

Odysseus also speaks with the spirit of Achilles, who laments his fate in the underworld and tells Odysseus that he would rather be a poor man’s servant than rule over all the dead. Odysseus tries to speak with the spirit of Ajax, but Ajax refuses to talk to him because he is still angry over the outcome of their quarrel over Achilles’ armor.

Odysseus then sees the spirits of many other famous figures from Greek mythology, including Heracles, Tantalus, and Sisyphus, before returning to his ship and sailing away from the land of the dead.

# The Odyssey - Book 12: The Cattle of the Sun

After leaving the land of the dead, Odysseus returns to Aeaea, where Circe gives him further instructions for his journey. She warns him of the Sirens, whose beautiful songs lure sailors to their deaths, and tells him how to avoid them. She also tells him of Scylla, a six-headed monster who will eat six of his men, and Charybdis, a whirlpool that will swallow his entire ship if he gets too close.

Odysseus follows Circe’s instructions and plugs his men’s ears with beeswax so they cannot hear the Sirens’ song. He himself listens to the song, but his men tie him to the mast so that he cannot steer the ship toward the Sirens.

Next, they encounter Scylla and Charybdis. Odysseus chooses to sail closer to Scylla, losing six of his men, rather than risk the entire ship in Charybdis. After they have passed Scylla and Charybdis, they reach the island of Thrinacia, where the sun god Helios keeps his sacred cattle.

Odysseus’s men, despite his warnings, kill and eat some of the cattle. Helios demands vengeance, and Zeus sends a storm that destroys Odysseus’s ship and kills all his men. Odysseus is washed ashore on the island of Ogygia, where the nymph Calypso takes him in and cares for him.
