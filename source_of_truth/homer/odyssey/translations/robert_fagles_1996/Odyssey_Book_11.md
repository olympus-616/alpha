# The Odyssey - Book 11: The Kingdom of the Dead

Odysseus continues his tale, describing his journey to the land of the dead. After leaving the island of Aeaea, Odysseus and his men sail to the land of the Cimmerians, a dark and misty place at the edge of the world. There, following Circe's instructions, Odysseus digs a trench and pours out libations of honey, milk, wine, and water to attract the spirits of the dead.

The first to appear is the spirit of Elpenor, one of Odysseus's men who died on Circe's island by falling from her roof. Elpenor begs Odysseus to return to Aeaea to give him a proper burial, and Odysseus agrees.

Next, the spirit of the blind prophet Tiresias appears. Tiresias tells Odysseus that Poseidon is punishing him for blinding his son, Polyphemus, but that he will eventually return home if he avoids harming the cattle of the sun god, Helios. Tiresias also warns Odysseus of the troubles awaiting him in Ithaca and advises him to make peace with Poseidon by offering a sacrifice when he reaches home.

Odysseus then speaks with the spirit of his mother, Anticleia, who tells him about the troubles in Ithaca, including the suitors who are vying for Penelope's hand. She also informs him of her own death, which was caused by grief over his long absence.

Odysseus speaks with the spirits of several famous figures from Greek mythology, including Agamemnon, who tells him of his murder at the hands of his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus; Achilles, who laments his fate in the underworld and tells Odysseus that he would rather be a servant to a poor man on earth than rule over all the dead; and Ajax, who refuses to speak to Odysseus because he is still angry over the outcome of their quarrel over Achilles' armor.

Finally, Odysseus sees the spirits of many other famous figures, including Heracles, Tantalus, and Sisyphus, before returning to his ship and sailing away from the land of the dead.
