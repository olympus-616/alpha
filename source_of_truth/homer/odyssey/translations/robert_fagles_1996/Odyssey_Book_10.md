# The Odyssey - Book 10: The Bewitching Queen of Aeaea

Odysseus and his men reached the island of Aeaea, home of the witch-goddess Circe. Circe turned Odysseus’s men into pigs, but Hermes gave Odysseus a magical herb called moly, which protected him from Circe’s spells. When Circe tried to turn Odysseus into a pig, the moly protected him, and he forced her to change his men back into their human forms.

Odysseus and his men stayed with Circe for a year, feasting and enjoying her hospitality, until his men finally convinced him to continue their journey home. Circe told Odysseus that he must visit the land of the dead and consult the prophet Tiresias before he could return to Ithaca.

Odysseus and his men sailed to the western edge of the world, to the land of the Cimmerians, where they performed the rituals Circe had instructed them to do. The spirits of the dead gathered around them, and Tiresias came forward to tell Odysseus that Poseidon would make his journey home difficult, but that he would eventually return to Ithaca if he avoided the cattle of the sun god, Helios.

Tiresias also told Odysseus that he would find trouble in his home, and that he would have to travel to a distant land to make a sacrifice to Poseidon before he could live out his life in peace.
