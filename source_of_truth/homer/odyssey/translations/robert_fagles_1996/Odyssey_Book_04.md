# The Odyssey - Book 4: The King and Queen of Sparta

As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, woke from his bed. He put on his clothes, hung his sharp sword over his shoulder, and bound his handsome sandals on his comely feet. Then he took his strong spear, tipped with sharp bronze, and went to the threshold of the hall.

He found his comrades outside the hall, and they greeted him with kind words. Telemachus told them to harness the horses to the chariot, and they obeyed. As they were busy doing this, a goddess, who looked like Nestor's son, took Telemachus aside and whispered in his ear, "Telemachus, the gods have given you the courage to embark on this journey. Do not delay any longer, but go at once to the house of Menelaus, where you will find a welcome. He will tell you all you wish to know about your father."

Telemachus obeyed the goddess, and they went together to the house of Menelaus, the dear son of Atreus. They found him at a banquet, entertaining his kinsmen in honor of the wedding of his son and daughter. The servants were busy serving the guests with meat and wine, and Menelaus himself was sitting among them.

When the two travelers entered the hall, a herald approached Menelaus and whispered in his ear, "My lord, two strangers have arrived. They look like the sons of gods, but I do not know who they are. Shall we welcome them, or send them away?"

Menelaus, the dear son of Atreus, was indignant at this suggestion. "How can you say such a thing?" he exclaimed. "Shall we, who have been fed by the gods, turn away those who seek our hospitality? Bring them here at once, and let them share our feast."

The herald obeyed, and soon the two travelers were standing before Menelaus. The king greeted them warmly and offered them food and drink. Telemachus, however, was too shy to eat or drink, and he kept his eyes fixed on the ground. At last, Menelaus said, "Strangers, tell me who you are, and what brings you to my house. Are you merchants, or travelers in search of news? Or have you come to seek my protection, as suppliants do?"

Telemachus blushed, and stammered out, "My lord, we are not merchants, but travelers in search of news. My name is Telemachus, and this is my companion. We have come from Ithaca, in search of my father, Odysseus, who has been missing for many years. We have heard that you know something of his fate, and we beg you to tell us all you know."

Menelaus was deeply moved by these words. "Telemachus," he said, "I am honored to welcome the son of my dear friend Odysseus. Your father was the wisest of men, and I loved him dearly. But, alas, I can tell you nothing of his fate. I have heard rumors that he is alive, but I cannot confirm them. All I can do is pray that he will return to you soon, and that you will be reunited with him."

With these words, Menelaus ordered his servants to prepare a feast in honor of his guests. The tables were laden with food and drink, and the guests ate and drank to their hearts' content. As they feasted, Menelaus told Telemachus and his companion the story of his adventures after the fall of Troy.

As the day drew to a close, Menelaus invited his guests to spend the night in his house. He showed them to their rooms, and they lay down to rest. But Telemachus could not sleep, for his mind was full of thoughts of his father. He tossed and turned in his bed, and at last, he got up and went to the window. The moon was shining brightly, and the stars were twinkling in the sky. Telemachus gazed at them for a long time, and at last, he whispered, "Father, where are you? Are you alive, or are you dead? Will...

But no answer came, and Telemachus sighed and went back to bed. He lay down and closed his eyes, but he could not sleep. At last, the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, and Telemachus rose from his bed. He dressed himself, and went to the threshold of the hall, where he found his comrades waiting for him.

They harnessed the horses to the chariot, and set out for Ithaca. As they rode along, Telemachus could not help but feel a sense of hope. He had not found his father, but he had learned that there was still a chance that Odysseus was alive. And so, as they rode through the morning mist, Telemachus prayed to the gods that they would grant him the courage and wisdom to find his father, and bring him home safely.
