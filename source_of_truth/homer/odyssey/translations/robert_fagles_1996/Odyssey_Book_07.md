# The Odyssey - Book 7: Phaeaciaâ€™s Halls and Gardens

When Odysseus had prayed, he went on toward the city. The goddess Athena, in the form of a young girl carrying a pitcher, met him at the gates. Odysseus asked her to show him the way to the palace of King Alcinous, and Athena led him there. She hid him in a thick mist so that no one would see him and wonder who this stranger might be. When they reached the palace, Athena touched him with her wand and made him appear as he was.

Odysseus stood in awe before the splendid house of King Alcinous. The walls were of bronze, the doors were of gold, and the pillars were of silver. The floors were made of marble, and the ceilings were decorated with inlaid ivory. Inside the house were gardens filled with fruit trees and flowers, and there were great vats of oil and wine.

The king and queen were seated on golden thrones, and their daughters were weaving fine linen at the looms. The king was giving orders to his heralds, and the queen was surrounded by her handmaids. 

Odysseus went up to the queen, knelt at her feet, and begged her for help. The king and queen were amazed at the sight of this stranger, and they asked him who he was and where he came from.

Odysseus told them his story and begged them to help him return to his homeland. The king was moved by his tale and promised to help him. He invited Odysseus to join him at his feast and offered him a place to sleep in his palace.

Odysseus was grateful for the king's kindness, and he joined the feast. The Phaeacians entertained him with song and dance, and Odysseus was moved by their hospitality. He prayed to the gods that he might return home safely.
