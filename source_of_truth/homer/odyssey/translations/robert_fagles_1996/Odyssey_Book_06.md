So here Odysseus slept, a man of sorrow and weariness, with pain and toil in his heart. But in the meantime, Athena went to the country and city of the Phaeacians. The people of Phaeacia once lived in broad Hypereia, near the Cyclopes, who were stronger than they and harried them continually. So their king Nausithous led them away to Scheria, far from all other men. He made a wall about the city, built houses and a temple for the gods, and divided the lands among his people. But now Nausithous had died and ...

When they reached the beautiful stream of the river, where there were washing cisterns of stone in which there was always plenty of clear water bubbling up and running off, no matter how much was done in it, they unyoked the mules and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy grass. Then they took the clothes out of the wagon, held them in their hands, and trod them in the water, while Nausicaa and her maids rolled up their sleeves and tucked up their clothes to work. As soon as they had washed the clothes...

Athena thought it time for Odysseus to wake up and see the beautiful girl who was to conduct him to the city of the Phaeacians.

At any rate, I will show you the way to the town, and tell you the name of the people. We are called Phaeacians, and I am the daughter of Alcinous, in whom the whole power of the state is vested."

Then she called her maids and said, "Stay where you are, you girls. I will go to the ship with this stranger myself, for he seems to be an honest man. But you must not take fright; we are all in the hands of the gods, and they can make you take courage if they like."

Then she turned to Odysseus and said, "Follow me, stranger, and I will take you to the house of my father, Alcinous. You will find a noble house, and you will see my mother sitting by the hearth and spinning her purple wool, by the light of the blazing fire."
