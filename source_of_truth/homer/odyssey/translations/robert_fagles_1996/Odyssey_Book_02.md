# The Odyssey - Book 2: Telemachus Sets Sail

Now when the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus rose and dressed himself. He hung his sword over his shoulder and bound his sandals on his comely feet. Then he took a doughty spear with a blade of sharpened bronze, and went to the threshold of the house, his presence like a god's.

He called his followers together and summoned the Achaeans to meet in assembly. They came hastily, and when they were got together, he went to take his place among them. On this occasion it was Aegyptius who spoke first, a man bent double with age, and of infinite experience. He was very wise, and was well known to all men for his ability in council and in action; his son Antiphus had gone with Odysseus to Ilius, land of noble steeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him in his cave, and had cooked him for dinner. He had three sons left, of whom two still worked on their father's land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the suitors. Nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and was constantly weeping for him. As for this assembly, he knew nothing about it, and had no idea who had convened it, so he said:

"Who has summoned us to the assembly? I suppose it must be some young man, though not a man like Telemachus. But as it is, the gods know who called us here. He must have some special reason for doing so." And he sighed as he thought of the brave son of Odysseus.

Then Telemachus rose to speak. He took his stand on the speaker's platform, holding a bronze spear, and his herald Pisenor gave him his staff. He was burning with anger, and his heart was full of grief as he began to speak to the assembly:

"Old man," he said, "the man who has convened this assembly is no other than myself. But it is not for any public matter that I speak, but for my own private sorrow. There is a house, which once was great and famous, but now it is falling into ruin, and all because of the wickedness of the suitors. These men, sons of the noblest families in Ithaca and the neighboring islands, are wooing my mother against her will, and they are devouring the wealth of my father. They are feasting and drinking at my expense, and they are ruining the estate, which is the only legacy I have from my father."

Telemachus threw his staff to the ground, and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke thus:

"Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault, not ours, for she is a very artful woman. This three or four years past, and even longer, she has been driving us out of our minds by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'My lords,' she said, 'please wait, for I have a task on hand which I must finish before I can think of marriage, and as soon as I have finished it, I will marry the man who is most pleasing to me.'"

Telemachus answered, "Antinous, how can I drive the mother who bore me from my father's house? My father is abroad, and we do not know whether he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me, but heaven will also punish me; for my mother, when she leaves the house, will call on the Erinyes to avenge her. Besides, it will show what kind of man I am, and make people talk about me."
