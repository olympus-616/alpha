# The Odyssey - Book 5: Odysseusâ€”Nymph and Shipwreck

When the morning star rose and the rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, the gods met in council and Zeus took his seat. He turned to Athena and said, "My child, you have never forgotten Odysseus, who is wise above all men. Yet, as for his return, it is still in doubt. Calypso holds him captive, and he has no ship to take him home."

Athena replied, "Father, if it is indeed your will that Odysseus should return, let Hermes go to the island of Ogygia and tell Calypso that she must send him on his way. But as for the suitors, let me go to Ithaca to inspire his son Telemachus, and give him the courage to go in search of his father."

Zeus consented, and Hermes flew to the island of Ogygia, where he found Calypso. She was sitting in her cave, singing sweetly as she wove at her loom. When she saw Hermes, she greeted him warmly and asked him what had brought him to her island.

Hermes told her of Zeus's command, and Calypso's heart was filled with sorrow. "How cruel you are, O gods!" she cried. "Why do you grudge me the love of this mortal man? Still, I cannot disobey the commands of Zeus. I will let Odysseus go, but I will not help him to leave. He must build his own ship and sail away."

With these words, she led Hermes to Odysseus, who was sitting on the shore, weeping as he gazed out over the sea. When he saw Hermes, he rose to his feet and asked him why he had come.

Hermes delivered the message from Zeus, and Odysseus's heart was filled with joy. He thanked Hermes and went to find Calypso. She greeted him kindly and told him of the gods' command. Odysseus was overjoyed, but he was also fearful. "How can I build a ship with my own hands?" he asked. "I have no tools, and no help."

Calypso smiled and said, "Do not fear, Odysseus. I will help you. I will show you where to find the trees you need, and I will give you tools and provisions for your journey."

So they set to work, and in four days Odysseus had built a sturdy ship. On the fifth day, he bade farewell to Calypso, and she gave him provisions for his journey. Then he set sail, with a gentle breeze to carry him on his way.

For seventeen days he sailed without mishap, but on the eighteenth day, Poseidon saw him and was filled with rage. He summoned the winds and the waves, and a terrible storm arose. The ship was dashed to pieces, and Odysseus was thrown into the sea.

For two days and two nights, he was tossed about by the waves, but on the third day, he was washed ashore on the island of the Phaeacians. Exhausted, he crawled into a thicket and fell into a deep sleep.
