# The Odyssey - Book 3: King Nestor Remembers

As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, the son of Odysseus rose from his bed and dressed himself. He slung his sword over his shoulder and tied the beautiful sandals on his comely feet. Then he went forth from his chamber, looking like an immortal god. He bade the heralds to summon the long-haired Achaeans to assembly, and they called them to the place of assembly. When the Achaeans were gathered in one place, he went and took his place in the assembly, holding a bronze spear; and Athena, assuming the form of Mentor, went with him.

Then Nestor, the Gerenian horseman, rose to speak: "Friends, hear me. To-day we have held assembly, as we always do at the festival of Poseidon. Let us therefore offer prayers and sacrifices to the god who has blessed us with peace and the safe return of our ships. Let no man, young or old, hold back, for that would be displeasing to the god. Let us offer sacrifices to Poseidon, the earth-shaker, who holds sway over all the sea."

With these words he led the way to the altar of Poseidon, and they followed him with reverence. When they reached the altar, they offered up a choice heifer, which they flayed and dressed. They cut out the thigh bones, wrapped them in two layers of fat, and placed raw pieces of meat on top. Then they burned the thigh bones with wood and poured wine over them while the young men stood by with five-pronged spits in their hands. When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the entrails, they cut up the rest of the meat and roasted it on the spits.

Meanwhile, the son of Nestor prepared a cup of wine mixed with water and handed it to Mentor, who had assumed the form of a mortal man. Mentor took the cup and prayed to Athena:

"Great queen Athena, vouchsafe that Telemachus may accomplish all that he has come to do, and that he may return to his home with honor."

Then Nestor, the Gerenian horseman, spoke: "Young man, may you accomplish your purpose and return with a heart full of wisdom and with great glory. But now, let us pour a libation to the gods and then go to sleep, for the time to rest has come."

So they poured a libation to the gods and drank the wine. Then they went to their rest and lay down in the shadow of the ship. 

When the child of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, Telemachus went to Nestor's couch and woke him with a gentle touch. "Rise, Nestor," he said, "let us go to the ship that we may offer a sacrifice to the gods before we set sail."

Nestor rose at once and the two of them went to the ship. The others followed, and they brought the heifer with them. When they reached the ship, they offered up a sacrifice to the gods, and after they had burned the thighs and tasted the entrails, they roasted the rest of the meat. 

When they had eaten and drunk to their hearts' content, Nestor spoke: "Young man, may you return to your home with a heart full of wisdom and with great glory. But now, let us pour a libation to the gods, and then go to sleep, for the time to rest has come."

So they poured a libation to the gods, and when they had done so, they went to their rest and lay down in the shadow of the ship.
