# Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) Summary

The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a fundamental security concept that states that a user, application, or system component should be granted the minimum level of access—or privileges—necessary to perform its functions.

Key Points:
1. Minimized Risk: By restricting access to only what is necessary, the risk of accidental or malicious misuse of privileges is significantly reduced.

2. Access Control: Each user or system component should only have access to the resources, data, and commands that are essential for their specific tasks, with no additional permissions.

3. Isolation: In the event of a security breach, limiting privileges can help contain the damage to a smaller part of the system, preventing the attacker from accessing more sensitive parts.

4. Regular Review: Permissions should be regularly audited and adjusted to ensure that they continue to align with the user's or system's actual needs.

5. Application in Development: For the Athena project, PoLP will be applied by ensuring that all contributors, components, and automated processes are given only the necessary permissions required for their specific roles, protecting the integrity and security of the software throughout its lifecycle.
