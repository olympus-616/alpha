## Overview

The Proteus module serves as the Identity Management, Authorization, and Authentication module within Olympus-616. Named after the Greek god of shape-shifting and adaptability, Proteus represents the flexible and dynamic nature of managing identities, roles, and access for both human and non-human interactions within and outside of Olympus-616. This module is crucial for ensuring that the right entities have the right access at the right time, while maintaining the security and integrity of the system.

## Scope of Responsibility

The Proteus module governs the following areas:

### 1. **Identity Management**
   - Managing identities within Olympus-616, including user profiles, system roles, and non-human entities.
   - Ensuring that all identities are accurately represented and securely managed.

### 2. **Authorization and Access Control**
   - Defining and enforcing access control policies to ensure that users and entities have appropriate permissions.
   - Adapting to changes in roles and permissions dynamically to maintain security and efficiency.

### 3. **Authentication**
   - Implementing robust authentication mechanisms to verify the identities of users and entities within Olympus-616.
   - Ensuring that authentication processes are secure, seamless, and adaptable to various contexts.

### 4. **Integration with Other Modules**
   - Collaborating with other modules to ensure that identity management, authorization, and authentication are seamlessly integrated into the broader system architecture.
   - Harmonizing the principles of adaptability and security with the operations and decision-making processes throughout Olympus-616.

## Components Overview

The Proteus module oversees several components that facilitate its responsibilities within Olympus-616. Each component is designed to ensure the module's responsibilities are met without compromising the system's integrity.

## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Proteus no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Proteus module.
- Ensure alignment between the Proteus module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
