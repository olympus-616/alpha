## Deprecation Strategy

If a component or module within Buddha no longer serves a clear purpose or its responsibilities are absorbed by another component, it should be marked for deprecation. This includes updating its source of truth, documenting the reason for deprecation, and ensuring all dependencies are carefully managed during its removal.

## Next Steps

- Regularly update this document to reflect changes within the Buddha module.
- Ensure alignment between the Buddha module and the overarching Zeus architecture.
